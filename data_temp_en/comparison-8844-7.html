 tourists are richer because of the mere fact of traveling. of course there are budgets for all tastes.. it seems to me . 
<br>  the promoter exposes. it is a solidarity rate. if we have money to see a city and enjoy its services, that by the way, they pay their neighbors. sure it is not very burdensome, pay one, per night . 
<br> the services I understand it and it is certainly unfair for the registered persons to pay through taxes a service that is subsequently taken advantage of by other people; . 
<br>  the collected is destined to the coffers of the city council for that we already have managers who have and must work to not leave them empty. in any case seems to me a great initiatory yours .

It seems to me that she has not understood well what the promoter exposes. it is a solidarity rate. if we have money to see a city and enjoy its services, that by the way, they pay their neighbors. sure it is not very burdensome, pay one, per night for a solidarity purpose. even in order to make the city more welcoming to everyone.
<br>Proposed to charge visitors a price different from that of those registered by the municipal public services, to compensate for the subsidized part of the consistory. (25 supports) since you have less support than your proposal, I'm going to include yours in the list of unrepealed proposals. (41 support)

 writers : tourists are richer because of the fact of traveling. of course there are budgets for all tastes.. . 
<br>  they say it is fair to me that a tourist should be "forced" to be in solidarity.You justify tax in which he is in solidarity, . 
<br>  writers : our own interests do not let us be solidarity? on the other hand I . 
<br> I think about is public transport.to this problem I come up with two other solutions apart from the solidarity tax:1. . 
<br>  it comes to be compensated).2. to charge visitors a price different from that of those registered by the municipal public services, to compensate for the subsidized part of the registered person and, . 
<br>  (I already explain in the body of the possible destinations) at no time wish that the collected is destined to the coffers of the city council .

the arrival of tourists to the city already results in a source of income for the city council through taxes to all the activities it carries out
<br>so i do not see the justification that they pay another tax more.as well , neither has more goods, nor presents any distinguishing characteristic that motivates them to pay taxes that other collectives do not pay
<br>the inhabitants of madrid also do tourism and for each other
<br>it comes to be compensated).2. to charge visitors a price different from that of those registered by the municipal public services
<br>those tourists who do not use these services are not forced to pay for them

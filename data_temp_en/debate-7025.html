- Yes. I don't understand how for example in Roma there are fountains everywhere and in madrid you see them and you want them to find water in summer, with the heat it makes..
<br>- madrid is a city with very high temperatures in summer and it is difficult to find sources of drinking water on the street, unlike other European cities.
<br>- I agree if they are sources of drinking water.
<br>- in a city where its water is famous for being very good and with such high temperatures in summer, it is incredible that there are no sources of drinking water. I would only propose that the model of source outside of those where dogs can drink in a lower overflow but have no access to reach the pipe.
<br>- it is not clear to me in the proposal whether you refer to sources of drinking water or sources (monuments) of squares, parks, etc. greetings!.
<br>- you should rethink your proposal in a way that is not so ambiguous. many of us are not sure whether you are referring to drinking water sources (drinkers) or decorative sources. if it is the first, I support the proposal.
<br>- Have you not seen the waste of water that usually carries a fountain? the water balloons, for example, are a very usual fun but in my opinion, very expensive, in every way.
<br>- is that people use them properly. the water balloons that I have seen are usually thrown only in the warmer months, July-August and for certain hours. have seen waste much bigger than the water globes even so it would have to denounce ewtas practices.
<br>- of those that do not have access to dogs. for this there is a overflow of water that comes out from above.!!not to waste!!
<br>- I've talked about waste: teaching children that water is a very precious asset. Sources are not a fun. and denounce these practices... to whom, where.<br>

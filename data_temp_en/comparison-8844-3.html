 tourists are richer because of the mere fact of traveling. of course there are budgets for all tastes.. it seems to me . 
<br>  the promoter exposes. it is a solidarity rate. if we have money to see a city and enjoy its services, that by the way, they pay their neighbors. sure it is not very burdensome, pay one, per night . 
<br> the services I understand it and it is certainly unfair for the registered persons to pay through taxes a service that is subsequently taken advantage of by other people; . 
<br>  the collected is destined to the coffers of the city council for that we already have managers who have and must work to not leave them empty. in any case seems to me a great initiatory yours .

the arrival of tourists to the city already results in a source of income for the city council through taxes to all the activities it carries out

<br>the inhabitants of madrid also do tourism and for each other
<br>it comes to be compensated).2. to charge visitors a price different from that of those registered by the municipal public services
<br>those tourists who do not use these services are not forced to pay for them

he says the justification of such tax.the arrival of tourists to the city already results in a source of income .
<br>is a fee that is paid in many european cities, usually to tourist .
<br>tourists are richer because of the mere fact of traveling. .
<br>the justification is solidarity. its end .
<br>here what is proposed is for solidarity .madrid : services i understand it and it is unfair for the registered persons to pay through taxes a service .
<br>(it is also true that not all madridns leave, .
<br>thus, tourists do not benefit from the taxes of the registered person and, in turn, those who do not use these services .
<br>madrid is the capital of spain and are forced to spend the night in a city .<br>

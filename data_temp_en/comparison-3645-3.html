 the city council would organize them it would be to do without having professionals who know their work well. perfect that kennels and protectors organize them, this proposal is not for them to stop doing it, . 
<br>  the town council offers training opportunities to owners, the approach and the content of them should be studied, see the needs that there are, that they have been seen the lack of respect of each other, . 
<br> canine municipal schools exist in other localities providing a necessary service for the great demand there is. I understand that you do not like the idea, you will see it as competition, . 
<br>  the obvious, is very complex and very difficult, you have to know how to read the dog, look at its body posture, its emotional state, . 
<br>  the proposal could be a great first step and a wonderful approach for many people with dogs (s), and also for those who do not have or wish to have, to a series of responsibilities .
<br> I is a professional) cynismos of the style "I invite you"... . 
<br>  I believe that they do not contribute much and it is, in the end, to get lost in banalities . 
<br>  in the proposal it says to learn about dog psychology, which is not turkey mucus, . 
<br> I is a simple label, you look at details that deviate you from the topic I want to propose: "municipal canine education courses", it is a lot of information that can be accessed on the internet and anyone can find it if you fix the courses of responsible tenure are courses of education. I see some needs and I wish you every success in your work. great idea! many dog owners would love to receive some lessons to learn how to treat their pet . 
<br> dog poop on the street. Please vote it out and give it out. very good proposal. Education is fundamental. Greetings alberto, please do not multiply your message over and over again, hinder the dialogue . 
<br>  the owners of the dogs should be fined who carry them loose and without muzzle, besides those who leave the streets of madrid made a tern, more control by the city council. no proposal . 
<br> no, Troll is dedicated to responding to all the comments of others with that little phrase or you are several who seem to know only to say that... if by making a proposal you mean to start one . 
<br>  no, Troll have supported many others... just as there are so many since I think nothing more than to propose... maybe some people should read a little more what others put before putting 7 "different proposals" that are actually the same, because in that way all they achieve is to divide the supports... and well, you don't deserve

voted. i propose zones so that dogs can be free and pee-can, voted::::::::://////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
<br>i have to tell you that canine municipal schools exist in other territories providing a necessary service for the great demand there is
<br>i ask the administration a way of learning for the owners of dogs . it seems that you find it difficult to understand that there is a vacuum and a problem that needs to be solved
<br>i would like to be able to comment that i fear you have taken yourself in a somewhat defensive way (it is not an attack on your person or any of your professional colleagues )
<br>as cj comments the important thing is that everything adds up and brings its granite into a common cause
<br>i happily invite you to bring constructive ideas and help enrich the proposal with your experience in the matter
<br>but sometimes you get tired as they disregard your work and dedication
<br>there is not much more to say, that it differs in some points does not mean that i do not take the subject seriously
<br>as i have given courses in shelters and kennels
<br>i have also given urban education workshops in madrid center
<br>there are multitude of educators who do it and in very accessible areas
<br>there 's a very good proposal to end dog poop on the street
<br>there is no reason for everyone to wear it
<br>i would pay 10 per month for that pet that i care for and gives me affection without doubt
<br>i do n't really want everyone 's money to go to education courses for dog owners
<br>i would simplify things if you 're not civic with your dog that you wo n't be allowed to have more
<br>the money of all subsidizes in part the courses , workshops and workshops
<br>i do n''t think that people who have dogs have less rights than the rest . now as it is fashionable to have a dog behaving like a crazed for our whim would be more likely to say something against

 voted. I propose zones so that dogs can be free and pee-can, voted: Thank you for your support, I am also lola. thanks for your contribution. Thank you, bil. as a canine educator I see it for nothing.Animal behavior is very complex.What if I bet is for courses on responsible trend, I have given them in kennels and protectors and
<br> it is not like cesar millan that comes to a house, it makes the dog indefension and arranged.. I don't see it as a competition, I dedicate myself to the canine sports world and to working dogs, I just say the obvious, the etology is very complex and very difficult, you have to know how to read the dog, look at its body posture,
<br> cj, the most important thing is to start! and then naturally (as happens with everything) and over time grow in order to be able to offer solution and help to more needs. a very cordial greeting, and hope your proposals:) ulises. I am totally convinced that you will agree bil:) but please avoid on a subject like this (especially being a professional) 
<br> if you have felt offended, it is not even much less the intention when I write, you see that writing I am really rude. I am not announcing any course, you look at details that deviate you from the topic I want to propose: "municipal canine education courses", it is a generic title, the purpose is to serve to classify the proposal and be found in the searches.
<br>. a very good proposal to end dog poop on the street. Please vote it out and give it out. Very good proposal. Education is fundamental. voted: participatory proposal that helps solve the problem: do you disseminate it?:. this is the only proposal relating to animal rights which has a proposal on animal rights. vote: yes, this is a good proposal 
<br> a course of those characteristics will be a kind of permission to have them. I would simplify things if you're not civic with your dog that you won't be allowed to have more, so the rest of the citizens don t have to put up with shit, loose dogs, and typical phrases like 'if you do nothing'. I don't think that people who have dogs have

nothing.animal behavior is very complex.what if i bet is for courses on responsible trend, i have given them in kennels .
<br>sure, animal behavior is complex but i do not see that in an assumption that the city council would be to do without having professionals who know their work .
<br>canine : canine basic education should be a service of city council .the canine sports world is a competition, stimuli, .
<br>he says it 's necessary that the administration provide spaces that meet the demand of citizens.. .
<br>the : the proposal could be a great first step and a wonderful approach for many people .
<br>veterinary etology is studied at the university, the one who wants to dedicate himself professionally is what he would have to do, .hello umezza, sorry for the delay in answering, i have had a few crazy days of training .
<br>the second part has been published first and then the last message hahaha... so i recommend reading it in reverse
<br>you"... : i am not at any time saying that you do not already, and i repeat, all help is little to achieve a goal so important (i am totally convinced
<br>a very cordial greeting, and hope your proposals:) .hello at no time i have shown aggression no, .
<br>the proposal is a simple label, you look at details .
<br>i am not announcing any course therefore there is no index of contents, nor nuances. nor .
<br>he see some needs and i make a proposal, because i think that in the long term, would make us a more respectful society .the owners of the dogs should be fined who carry them loose and without muzzle, besides those who leave madrid .
<br>there's a very good proposal to end dog poop .
<br>the ordinance, dangerous dogs have to wear muzzles. .
<br>the citizenry, is created by education. .
<br>please vote it out and give it .
<br>please vote out and give it out. .he says he does not know if you are mr troll who is dedicated to responding to all the comments of others with that little phrase manipulated in that way all they achieve is to divide the supports...
<br>really want everyone's money to go to education courses for dog .
<br>the rest of the citizens don ÃÅt have to put up with shit, loose dogs, and typical phrases like... .
<br>it would be better if these courses were for those who don't have a dog and want to have it, a kind of permission .
<br>the case is that currently the city council does n't offer .<br>

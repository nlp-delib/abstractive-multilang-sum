 reformed please!!!. Besides, the monument is terribly ugly and unworthy of the biggest attack that has been in Spanish history. I support the reform.. I think what happens to him from the outside is dirt from the exhaust pipes of the vehicles. I also support the proposal to change or make modifications so that we know what it is, since many people who visit us from outside Madrid have no idea what that monument means
<br> a pity that it looks dirty and broken, the haste left this impersonal and ugly monument without any feeling, besides I think nobody likes it. a great missed opportunity. ugly, really ugly and not emotional at all. to top it is always ruined and now we are told that they will pay 200,000 euros to fix it??!!!!!!!!!!! nor talk! but please don't dedicate

 the monument is quite ugly, and I of the biggest attack in Spanish . 
<br>  as a simple proposal if water were added to it that was intended to make to the victims of that fateful date. a great missed opportunity to create an emblem of the city. great historical error.. totally agree, bottling . 
<br> this monument was built on the basis of an architectural contest. the winning team designed a monument that doesn't look like the one built. the rushes to lift the monument . 
<br>  the site could not be more aggressive and inhospitable. in short, it does not bring anything. a great missed opportunity. ugly, really ugly and not emotional at all. to top it is always ruined . 
<br>  we are told that they will pay 200,000 euros to fix it??!!!!!! nor talk! there are many more useful things to do with that money. I really prefer that

I think what happens to him from the outside is dirt from the exhaust pipes of the vehicles. regardless of the beauty or not of the monument, the truth is that since it was put a terrible bottleneck was created in that roundabout, since lanes were removed, and entering well is a little war. I support the reform.
<br>This monument was built on the basis of an architectural contest. the winning team designed a monument that doesn't look like the one built. the rushes to lift the monument forced a great builder to simplify it to intolerable limits. in short, it does not represent anyone, dirty the memory, does not bring anything. a great missed opportunity.

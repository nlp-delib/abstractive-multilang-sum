 felix there are many children with a serious illness such as leukemia who do not have a degree of disability so they do not get access to the parking card and children . 
<br>  the parents of children under three years of age who have any serious illness or disability cannot park in spaces for the disabled, are children who must be cared for continuously .

to receive a parking card it is necessary to first have a recognized degree of disability
<br>there are many people who ca n't drive because of their physical condition or simply because they do not know but if they need to move by car and others help them
<br>i do n't understand the reason for this proposal if in principle i think it is contemplating . i am in favour of measures being taken to reduce pollution . but we need to go to our medical consultations and treatments in madrid

 this proposal is phenomenal.. all my support for this proposal, and I hope the 54 thousand more.. madrid, give example and allow children under three years of age to have disabled parking card to receive their treatment. is a shame.. do it now.. I sign your proposal. I think it is asking very little and yet would help them a lot.. thank you for your support, and i hope

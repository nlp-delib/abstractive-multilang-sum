 totally agree, the acoustic pollution is of the highest in cities like madrid. controlling these things makes it much more conducive the coexistence without doubt... throwing firecrackers on the street is forbidden . 
<br>  totally unheard of that they never see the same in front of their noses. in order to enforce this prohibition, it would be necessary to have a policeman on every street . 
<br> I'm am open to ideas or suggestions to get them to start putting them (at best, my proposal is not the best). I called again for the same reason . 
<br>  the proposal will improve something that comments more for the police by fines and sanction the following behaviors. Maybe that scares me very much.I don't want a police state without any civil rights.I do not want this to end up becoming a state similar to v de vendetta. or vendetta v. a complementary noise.multiply .

<br>it 's good enough for those who hold authority to look elsewhere .he overstepped a police car, with the driver's window .
<br>two firecrapers in less than a minute, the window down, without the lights on that would indicate that they were going to do a service at that moment,
<br>followed a couple of meters ahead, blew another one in the middle of the bike .
<br>i was walking on the sidewalk when i heard several meters behind me blow a firecracker. .
<br>course, : it can only be enforced if you are a witness to incivic behaviour, .<br>

<br>it is forbidden both to sell and to turn them on within the municipal term
<br>in england people are respectful of cleanliness and noises and i don't think there is a cop on every street
<br>i think it would be more useful to veto the sale of these products to individuals
<br>but to say the potential problems that they can create when they exploit
<br>i do n't want a police state without any civil rights . i do not want this to end up becoming a state similar to v de vendetta , or vendetta v.

 Yes. madrid is a city with very high temperatures in summer . 
<br>  it is difficult to find sources of drinking water on the street, unlike other European . 
<br>  the model of source outside of those where dogs can drink in a lower overflow .

 very expensive, in every way. I would only propose that the model of source outside of those where dogs can drink in a lower overflow but have no access to reach the pipe. for this there is an overflow of water that comes out from above.!!not to waste!! I've talked about waste: teaching children that water is a very precious asset. Sources are not a fun. and denounce these

roma madrid is a city with very high temperatures in summer .
<br>in a city where its water is famous for being very good and with such high temperatures in summer, it is incredible that there are no sources .
<br>the model of source outside of those where dogs can drink in a lower overflow but have no access to reach the pipe. .
<br>if they are sources of drinking .
<br>it is not clear to me in the proposal whether you refer to sources of squares, parks, .<br>

I don't understand how for example in Roma there are fountains everywhere and in madrid you see them and you want them to find water in summer, with the heat it makes. I would only propose that the model of source outside of those where dogs can drink in a lower overflow but have no access to reach the pipe.

 dark (3,75 /hour). I find it intolerable that an hour of tennis costs more than 10,00, it is even more expensive than going to the cinema.It . 
<br>  the goal is to play the child and, of course, children (except the "prodigy") of short age need an adult to direct and encourage them. some examples of cheaper rates . 
<br> town of the racket (in the morning and with bonus 2x1): 5.80 (inthe morning): 8 eurosmagic box (Monday morning): 9 eurosmunicipal tracks .

sport should be linked to health and it is logical that measures should be taken to promote it and a very good one would be to reduce rates and make bonuses that do so even private tennis clubs
<br>i find it intolerable that an hour of tennis costs more than 10,000 , it is even more expensive than going to the cinema
<br>it is necessary to reduce the general price of municipal tracks
<br>the quality of the tracks is very low.cracked and unchecked tracks

<br>the tracks are already expensive by themselves, .
<br>the proposal does not serve to make discounts in the price of the hourly zones of minimum occupancy .it is necessary to reduce the general price of municipal tracks and, in the shorter hours of demand (morning .

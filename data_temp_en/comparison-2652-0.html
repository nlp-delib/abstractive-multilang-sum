it 's not a bad idea but how to do it
<br>you'd have to put special trucks that pick up garbage on the portal and take them to the subway
<br>the first would be to promote the concept near the subway mouths with elevators
<br>other subway operators could lower the cubes at night and wait for the car enabled to pass to transport the garbage cubes
<br>in fact that the problem of containers is that they are collected with little assiduousness
<br>in principle the collection of garbage would be made in night hours with what the users of the metro and the containers would not cross
<br>the bags would be paid with advertising . in this way we ensure that the problems of health are a little more controlled
<br>the people with reduced mobility hate the current cubes (impossible to open) the glass-collected domes with the mouth so high
<br>in germany the town hall regales the yellow bags for the recycling of containers
<br>on the municipal council there is a piece of furniture from where you can take a roll of bags per person
<br>since you say that we would end up with the bad smells on the street
<br>the containers would have to be sealed before entering the metro
<br>and disinfected on the outside (both in terms of sanitary and odours) )
<br>i say that the idea is interesting, if the metro is not used to transport some kind of goods
<br>and we build on the surface a network of trams or trolleybuses or floating trains
<br>for people and cars we leave them out of the city in strategic parking lots
<br>i like that you like it . the idea is not to take a walk to take the garbage
<br>it seems to me very ingenious! that the collection and transport of the garbage is done in the basement
<br>but we would also not have to rule out that , instead of doing it in the subway cars
<br>with this voting system on this web we do n't get the 54,000 support or pussy....................................................................................................................
<br>i agree , and it 's a shame you do n't have enough reception
<br>i do n't see the difficulty of lowering the garbage cans from the street to a platform in an elevator , putting it in a wagon at 3 in the morning
<br>it 's the first time that it was possible to do it and in an ideal world it happened more often

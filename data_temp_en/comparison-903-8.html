the use of public transport is not encouraged outside peak .
<br>they could also lower the price of the metro bonus .
<br>the bus drivers were not so abrupt, and the subway didn't smell .
<br>for example, in london, it was much cheaper .
<br>what you're commenting on in your proposal, is what has londons with a card. .the unemployed is exclusively for those who are receiving a benefit from the so-called "extraordinary" which is only available 6 months .
<br>do not fool us the president of the madrid community with that patch and include all the unemployed. unemployed. .
<br>quadno exits, can connect to a mobile phone with nfc or sticker .
<br>it is important this since the media call them "long-term unemployed", .<br>

I think very good ideas, but I also propose a cheaper metro bus for children and young people. Those who have two or more children we spend a pasta every time we use the metro or bus (cheap rooms the private car and the ticket of the hour) more info about my proposal in twitter @metrobusjovenya.
<br>It is important to add that what has just been proposed is exclusively for those who are receiving a benefit from the so-called "extraordinary" which is only available 6 months after they have lost the right to the usual benefit. Do not fool us the president of the madrid community with that patch and include all the other proposals.

because the use of public transport is not encouraged outside peak hours
<br>for example , it was much cheaper to take out a simple ticket to use between 09.30 and 4.30 than for the rest of the day
<br>the age of the young fertilizer is increased but those who do not opt for it and we also work need to be more economical
<br>what has just been proposed today with regard to the unemployed is exclusively for those who are receiving a benefit from the so-called "extraordinary "
<br>it is important this since the media call them "long-term unemployed "
<br>do not fool us the president of the madrid community with that patch and include all the unemployed

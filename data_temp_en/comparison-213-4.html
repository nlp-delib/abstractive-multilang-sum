I am in favour of the posts being covered by personnel derived from oppositions, and only when they are exhausted will they go to unemployment. I suggest you take a look at this one that you will certainly support. Considering that in Madrid, independent food banks that operate have only 4 employees and 450 volunteers, the creation of a municipally run and public food bank would generate an environment number of 500 jobs.

empty tracks x the high price and next to people doing botelln .
<br>an hour of tennis costs more than 10,00, it is even more expensive than going to the cinema.it would be interesting .
<br>the tracks are already expensive by themselves, .
<br>the proposal does not serve to make discounts in the price of the hourly zones of minimum occupancy .it is necessary to reduce the general price of municipal tracks and, in the shorter hours of demand (morning .
<br>in : in general a disaster that with a minimal investment could be fixed.. hi, thanks to the creators of this proposal.i don't know if this is the mechanism for doing something
<br>the price. is an excessive price. .
<br>on the other hand i want to contribute the bad conditions in which there are many of the tracks. .<br>

 more abundant on this issue, if the tracks are already expensive by themselves, but still the light to play when it is dark (3,75 /hour). I find it intolerable that an hour of tennis costs more than 10,00, it is even more expensive than going to the cinema.It would also be interesting to improve the conditions for the reservation of facilities. although in many places you can already make telematic
<br> (...continuation) training ban on the tracks. in many multisports have been taken measures not to train on the slopes. any sport, as often as it is practiced, is trained more than played.in the summer the discounts of subscription *disappear*, but no longer for the tennis!it doesn't understand.and as you get off, you will again pay registration in autumn.

I find it intolerable that an hour of tennis costs more than 10,00, it is even more expensive than going to the cinema. The goal has to be to encourage sport. Modifying the fees of the facilities is a good way to do it and bring it closer to all people.
<br>Town of the racket (in the morning and with bonus 2x1): 5.80 euroscedars (inthe morning): 8 eurosmagic box (Monday morning): 9 eurosm municipal tracks (at any time/day): 13.80 this does not seem very reasonable. It is necessary to reduce the general price of municipal tracks.

sport should be linked to health and it is logical that measures should be taken to promote it and a very good one would be to reduce rates and make bonuses that do so even private tennis clubs
<br>i find it intolerable that an hour of tennis costs more than 10,000 , it is even more expensive than going to the cinema
<br>it is necessary to reduce the general price of municipal tracks
<br>the quality of the tracks is very low.cracked and unchecked tracks
<br>as you get off , you will again pay registration in autumn

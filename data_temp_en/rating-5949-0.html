- Good morning to all, cleaning is one of the parts of a society that we have to take care of all without exception, it is as important as the safety of a city or health for people, if we have insanity in a city we run a lot of risk in all aspects, I send you a link so that you enter to read it if you think it is correct to vote it, the points to deal with about cleaning are quite interesting, there is no need to make exaggerated investments, but, all this is over-proven and works, vote the idea if you like to get as many votes as possible in order to be able to react to the cleaning of madrid.
<br>- voted. In rent we have this problem with the dirt and lewdness of the neighborhood, please vote:
<br>- martina, what possibility do you find if the truck on my street passes over twelve o'clock in the night? that we pay more to the company that does the service of taking out and putting the cubes because the person who comes has to charge night time and we have only two 2 hours to lower the garbage? by live done the sidewalks are so narrow that you do not empty cabs with a wheelchair and the baby cars carry them on the road.
<br>- we could take all the garbage to your house so it doesn't bother the street.
<br>- no doubt the sidewalks will not be thought to leave the garbage bins. the madrid sitema that each building has its garbage bin seems absurd to me. I do not understand why they do not put general containers, both of organic waste as well as of others. the image of the cubes is regrettable, to apt as the Lord says we cannot pass through the sidewalk. the little consideration towards the pedestrian is very obvious from the administrations. we want to be able to make the garbage not only from 7pm. but at any time, for that it is necessary that there are general containers for everyone, that they take out parking spaces and put more containers..
<br>- the solution is to make sidewalks wider.
<br>- the only solution is to expand the sidewalks, since the centralized containers would involve such a number of them (at least in the central district) that they would end up becoming dirt spots as is now the case with the cardboard and furniture pick-up points.
<br>- not to the garbage bins on the sidewalks. I think it's great to detect the problem. how to solve it: (easy!!);) make on the roads that have parking for vehicles a space of 90 cm wide, in front of the portals, with two goes (as if it were the entrance to a garage) that delimits a space for the cube or cubes. thus you can place the cubes from the sidewalk by the neighbors and collect from the race by the operators. it would save 20% in the time of garbage collection (which would also amount to a saving of 20% on the budget), to do so would be very cheap and there would be no cubes in the sidewalk..
<br>- of course, as the parking space is left in the center, for there all the cubes... yes sir, very good idea!.
<br>- in well there are underground containers. on the road there are openings to deposit the trash and also with option of recycling on each street. I would see it the most viable option, other than that you can lower the trash at any time of the day and encourage recycling.
<br>- it is true that there is no spare space to park, but with the trash cubes on the sidewalks (in the zirita street where I live 80 percent are on sidewalks) there is also no space to walk. it may seem surrealistic but to enter the portal with a suitcase I have seen and desired them because neither between car and car could pass or walk with the garbage cubes. on two occasions I have had to carry the suitcase in one hand and push with the other a cube about 10/15 meters. in the end there has to be some solution because the cubes is almost prehistoric. a greeting!.
<br>- Yes because it was going to be the showy madrid center with general containers to store garbage at any time of the day. Of course it is uncomfortable about the cubes on the sidewalks but please, let's try to look among all realistic and definitive solutions. I as a neighbor of the center (mill fire), the only viable solution would be the installation of underground containers, which require a certain investment, while we will have to live with the buckets, at least this way throughout the day, until they are taken out, you can walk through the madrid centre.
<br>- not every street allows it.
<br>- that's right. my neighborhood (guindalera) has narrow streets, and so are the sidewalks. moreover many portals have no more than 5 houses, so the cubes do not fill. I have seen the dumpsters in my street, taking out by hand a couple of bags of a cube and putting them together in those of another portal, because it takes them a lot longer to empty each of them with the truck. almost all the cities have fixed containers, and they work wonderfully. That if, occupy parking spaces, and that to some people may seem a problem.
<br>- the pockets of dirt are such simply because the urban cleaning service is deficient. in other cities much care is taken to clean the container areas. I can also assure you that many streets, like mine, do not allow wider sidewalks.
<br>- in fact, it seems that the cohe has more priority than a person, they do have to have the right to park, even if people can't even go through the sidewalks.There are solutions, limit parking areas where sidewalks are narrow and create an alternative garbage system.
<br>I believe that there is no desire to make life easier for people and that does not give a vote. On the contrary, the car gives a lot of votes. These are very unpopular measures to remove outposts in the streets where the sidewalks are narrow and we can't even walk, and in those squares to put underground garbage systems, that there isn't dirt neither the street nor bad smells.
<br>- the walk through the center of madrid, will be in great way, the majority of streets, in the center has sidewalks where only one person passes, and when they take out the cubes, you can no longer walk, but it is endangering your physical integrity. I agree that a solution are the underground cubes. they avoid bad smells, crap and finally a endless things. is an inversion that at the end of the term of perfectly cushions..
<br>- I understand by general containers the underground of course. the cubes are usually dated about 18:00 hs. at that time it is transited through the street with carts of children etc. and it is very uncomfortable to go around drawing cubes and cars. the investment has to do it as has been done already years ago in many villages and capitals of province. greetings.
<br>- the urban service is poor and the urban population is even more deficient. I live in the center of madrid, in malasa√±a, in a street where there is hardly a sidewalk and barely enters a parked car (in the area being) and a car circulating. guess how the sidewalks would be wider. I think I've never used sidewalks around my area... they are a focus of dirt and unbearable stench.
<br>- all the streets allow it. the minimum width of a road run according to the pgoum are 350cm. that you would have so good sidewalks. and yes, I have car in the center of madrid: private parking. and who can not afford a private square but if a car, sell it or move it.
<br>- You're right, martina, I living in the center area did the same thing to me when I was carrying the car with the child. the only solution that I see viable, would be the pedestrianization of these streets since the sidewalks are almost nonexistent.allowing the passage to residents, services, and little more.<br>

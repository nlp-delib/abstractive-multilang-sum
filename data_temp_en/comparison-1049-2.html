 madrid will be for a day a city without cars the second: madrid. a greeting. voted. I like your proposal. count on my vote. Thank you gabriela. It takes momentum to make madrid more habitable. of all we will get it. thank you! count on your vote. counted on my votes:). count on our vote and all my impetus to defend
<br> the association of neighbors of center and the rest do not agree with the subject of pedestrianization because in doing so the locals and the bars would request to put more terraces in the streets that we already have when we have the necessary width to apply for the license. with the prevention of the entry into the area to the non-residents with their cars, problems of noise, pollution, parking for the residents and quality of life in

<br> you can insult me again, because I don't want to prioritize your proposals with comments. do you not have enough examples of pedestrian streets in madrid that in your day sold it as a benefit to the Madridns?Do you not know that invasion and appropriation dr the street is a desire of cadi all the hoteliers?Did you ignore that pedestrianizing the street, under the
<br>. It is not so difficult... it only takes will. a greeting and luck.. I am from the hostelry and I'm from the Latina. I support this motion including all the neighborhoods of the historic madrid. any European city that is valued have regulated traffic in the historical central area in a much more efficient and effective way than here. but of course, this is a personal opinion without importance.
<br> apr areas, seem to me completely insufficient. I live in the neighborhood letters and this is horrific. the cars that circulate through them, that are not few, go at all speed, painting you all day and giving you scars of death. and distribution, under strict schedule, with a maximum duration of 5 hours and weekends prohibited. if you have that privilege, I also want it. I support this

 project shade. There are examples of cities that have improved a lot as a plague where it is now a pleasure to walk and in Europe or what to say, you just have to see big cities like berna, munich, Thank you, Thank you, you, you, Thank Thank you, we'll you, we'll we'll you, you, . 
<br>  the must. I i: is one of those who think it is better to look for alternatives before banning, but as long as something has to be implemented, I support your action, . 
<br>  another proposal that seeks to reduce
<br> this would be achieved 100% if the conspicuous apr was implemented for the central area that we have been fighting for so long by the neighbors of the center. it is not necessary to pedestrianize . 
<br>  the subject of pedestrianization. We have been on the subject for many years and that would give wings to the restorers of the area that have always been overprotected . 
<br> the best of all is that some of those who don't want to leave the car threw pests out of the tobacco. I smoked years ago . 
<br>  I was arguing with others about the matter I set him a very clear example. you can lock yourself in a room and look at three work packages with closed windows and after a few hours you'll come out with your eyes going and your throat taken. in the same room turn on the engine of a car . 
<br>  the cars weren't interested in talking.The problem is that
<br> according to you karmela. those who so much cry for pedestrianization, it is because they have not pedestrianized their neighborhood and have not been able to check the supposed "advantages" such as: . 
<br>  the bars fill the street with chairs and tables, and the street goes from being everyone, to being only them. that it fills with bars of drinks and discos and drunks on the weekend . 
<br> dr lis nares of the center that I see every day is that there is no longer the public space pirque have taken over the owners of the bars.It is even allowed to put pots and barriers to "mark" their private territory (before it was public).This is not a more lively city. this is a scandal of privatization streets . 
<br>  I Simpl√≥n, in madrid has to date had perverse effects for residents, and the only thing that has been achieved with it is the proliferation of terraces and the increase of acoustic pollution.. it's a little short
<br> the great road can't be set up apr zone for between the week, but on weekends, from Friday to 18:00 until Monday . 
<br>  the cameras could be activated. It would also help the fact of encouraging the dissuasive parking in the madrid entrances . 
<br>  the cures have more right than the rest?????? and if not, that parking places for residents are built at normal prices, right now a parking place in the latina is quoted at 180 euros, . 
<br> the space." look, is the country of the ocde where inequality has advanced the most during the crisis. Inequality . 
<br>  it is essential for the city to recover the citizen life giving greater space to the citizen and less protagonism to the road traffic. wider sidewalks / recovery of public spaces .

5 cities around the world that want to stop using cars the first: madrid. The city would improve a great pedestrian path with space for banks, bicycles and green areas that project shade. There are examples of cities that have improved a lot as a plague where it is now a pleasure to walk.
<br>Neighbors of Madrid have been fighting for pedestrianization of central area for years. Proposal created to which you can vote as to this one: thank you. apr for the whole central zone of madrid is absolutely necessary. We would have to polish the proposal, but I think it is necessary to decongest the center ofmadrid.
<br>I hope that traffic will soon be restricted in the madrid centre, so that the clams unable to give up the car have to catch public transport by nose. The government team that casts itself against the drivers loses all the elections because they are an immense majority. The best of all is that some of those who don't want to leave the car threw pests out of the tobacco.
<br>I am against any pedestrianization, while there are caradura hoteliers in this city... that seem to exist many years. I do not like cars, but I prefer them before all that. If you encourage or give priority to electric cars throughout the city, it will be a very effective measure against pollution and will not affect the freedom of movement.
<br>Do you not know that invasion and appropriation of the street is a desire of cadi all the hoteliers? Did you ignore that pedestrianizing the street, under the pretext of improving life to all, is a meta excuse and a commercial strategy to end up taking hold of it and regret leaving a minimum space to the travellers? Are you living on Tuesday not to see what happens in front of your noses year after year?
<br>I think it's smarter to set up the apr throughout the center, allows residents and distributors access and decongests the center for greater pedestrian enjoyment. Any European city that is valued have regulated traffic in the historical central area in a much more efficient and effective way than here. I am outraged that there is a whole full sidewalk of places reserved for the nunciature and the church of San Miguel in the street sacrament.
<br>We're more than fed up with that public space, which is of all (my also) being permanently occupied by tables chairs, furniture and armatosts. How about if I make a parcel in the middle of the street, the fence and I put a social hall for my friends? if you have that privilege, I also want it. if I don't generate enough income without disturbing and invading others, think about it.

there are examples of cities that have improved a lot as a plague where it is now a pleasure to walk and in europe or what to say
<br>you knew that 1 in 8 deaths in the world are related to environmental pollution
<br>five cities around the world that want to stop using cars the first: madrid. sky in beijing before and after 2 weeks without 2.5 mm of cars
<br>i belong to the association of neighbors of center and the rest do not agree with the subject of pedestrianization
<br>we have been on the subject for many years and that would give wings to the restorers of the area that have always been overprotected by the city for economic interests
<br>let us hope that with now madrid the thing changes , but at the moment they are not very willing to it
<br>people are not aware because they are lazy and this makes them not want to leave the car nor, and much more worrying, think
<br>thanks to god there are some people who think like you
<br>i hope that traffic will soon be restricted in the madrid centre , so that the clams unable to give up the car have to catch public transport by nose
<br>the bars fill the street with chairs and tables and the street goes from being everyone- to being only them
<br>not granting new licenses would already bring queues because of the aggravation compared to all those who have them
<br>but i would like those who ask to do it first in your neighborhood and see the consequences
<br>i am against any pedestrianization , while there are caradura hoteliers in this city  that seem to exist many years
<br>simple........... . and much is you . do you not have enough examples of pedestrian streets in madrid that in your day sold it as a benefit to the madridns and then then you became private property
<br>all the cases of pedestrianization of the center that i see every day is that there is no longer the public space
<br>the only thing that has been achieved with it is the proliferation of terraces and the increase of acoustic pollution
<br>i am a neighbor of the latina and i am even the real nostrils of not being able to park and having to endure a traffic hell in the area
<br>the city council has removed places of resident in favor of others of long-term parking on the coast of the vega where we could park before and now not
<br>i am outraged that there is a whole full sidewalk of places reserved for the nunciature and the church of san miguel in the street
<br>i would say we are too right , because we suffer it day after day
<br>i support this proposal . taxis should not have access unless they are electric
<br>it is taxis and distributors that do not comply with the rules

- and we're proposing a tram.
<br>- the helmet is not mandatory for more than 15 years as they travel in the city. says dgt. otherwise, I give you the reason. they must comply with the traffic regulations. but, uh!... the drivers of cars and motorcycles also. there are too many that do not respect cyclists... did you know that in the town, a cyclist must occupy 1 lane of traffic... and not go by the edge?.
<br>- bikes that go along the sidewalks or off the bike lanes should be sanctioned.
<br>- if the bikes go through the sidewalks it is because it is very dangerous to go down the lanes of the cars even if they are marked. there is no awareness yet on the part of the users drivers. On the other hand, the fact itself of going down the sidewalk is not dangerous, as long as it goes "by foot".What you can not do is go fast.For me the real danger is in the night hours, in which many cyclists go without any light and you don't see until you are practically above them... that in Amsterdam is rigorously forbidden and is fined. here I have seen the municipal police pass everything when you see them....
<br>- obviously whoever says that hasn't taken a bike in his life, the bike helmet doesn't save lives, it's a fact, it saves lives the respectful driver.
<br>- never, but I've never seen a cyclist stop at a red light, or get on the sidewalk to cross by shooting pedestrians or directly jump him, at a pace of pedestrians less stop.What happens, that the rules are not for everyone alike? if a car jumps a light, the ticket is best! a little more respect, especially when they circulate along the sidewalk at the speed that gives them the desire, with the danger that it carries. they believe that everything is good and the street is theirs.
<br>- you can drive along the road, even if there is a nearby bicycle lane.
<br>- I don't believe it... never say it!
<br>- Don't you think it's generalizing too much? Not everyone goes with headphones, not everyone jumps the traffic lights, and cars have to settle for the presence of bikes....it's one more means of transport, and it deserves respect.
<br>- the obligation of the helmet to discourage the use of bicycles, which in the case of Tuesday is improving mobility without increasing pollution<br>

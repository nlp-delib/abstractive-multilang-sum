 a special exit, and then in destination the same thing.. equal if... the idea could be carried out in phases. the first would be to promote the concept near the subway mouths with elevators. you would have to make special (vertical) accesses on the subway for garbage containers and take them to the subway..
<br> the bags to pick up dog poop should give up the others, because... people save on that, and the truth, it didn't fall on it. The idea is that: 1) the bags are small enough for the daily garbage and so do not store more than necessary at home2) have no cost to the user3) close in a more efficient way than a shopping bag... (some shops hole the bags in the
<br> garbage. If it is already hot in summer that doesn't hold, imagine sharing tunnels with wagons carrying garbage. the garbage would be collected and transported in the hours that the subway network was closed if many. consider it a complementary proposal to the current system, since not everyone has a subway mouth nearby. for the topic of heat I have no proposal. even if they are not shared, the smell remains very

It's not a bad idea but how to do it? you'd have to put special trucks that pick up garbage on the portals and take them to the subway. you would have to make special (vertical) accesses on the subway for garbage containers, and they would be mounted directly on special trains or wagons, and then in destination the same thing, a special exit.
<br>The bags are small enough for the daily garbage and so do not store more than necessary at home. They have no cost to the user and close in a more efficient way than a shopping bag. In principle the collection of garbage would be made in night hours with what the users of the metro and the containers would not cross.
<br>I would keep the current system, adapting it to the needs of everyone. as to the subject of the smells, surely they would remain in the tunnels, and above with the heat that it does in summer. the smells would go away with the wagon just as they now go with the truck. although not all citizens have a subway mouth near if many. consider it a complementary proposal to theCurrent system.
<br>The idea is to use the metro as a transport system for other goods, not just for people. The containers would have to be sealed before entering the metro. This would mean that the smell of the metro would not be the same as in the tunnels. It would also mean that there would be no need to clean the metro every day.
<br>I like that you like it. the idea is not to take a walk to take the garbage, if you don't take the walk to dump the garbage. even if it was a minority of people who go to the subway every morning or live close to a subway mouth, that minority we are talking about hundreds of thousands of people.cleaning workers would not be left out of work, they would be relocated to cleaning tasks.
<br>I don't see the difficulty of lowering the garbage cans from the street to a platform in an elevator, putting it in a wagon at 3 in the morning, that a train from the 80s will pick them up and release them elsewhere. It's the first time that it was possible to do it and in an ideal world it happened more often, but for something it starts. I'm sure there's a better way, but today this is the best one.

it 's not a bad idea but how to do it
<br>you'd have to put special trucks that pick up garbage on the portal and take them to the subway
<br>the first would be to promote the concept near the subway mouths with elevators
<br>other subway operators could lower the cubes at night and wait for the car enabled to pass to transport the garbage cubes
<br>in fact that the problem of containers is that they are collected with little assiduousness
<br>in principle the collection of garbage would be made in night hours with what the users of the metro and the containers would not cross
<br>the bags would be paid with advertising . in this way we ensure that the problems of health are a little more controlled
<br>the people with reduced mobility hate the current cubes (impossible to open) the glass-collected domes with the mouth so high
<br>in germany the town hall regales the yellow bags for the recycling of containers
<br>on the municipal council there is a piece of furniture from where you can take a roll of bags per person
<br>since you say that we would end up with the bad smells on the street
<br>the containers would have to be sealed before entering the metro
<br>and disinfected on the outside (both in terms of sanitary and odours) )
<br>i say that the idea is interesting, if the metro is not used to transport some kind of goods
<br>and we build on the surface a network of trams or trolleybuses or floating trains
<br>for people and cars we leave them out of the city in strategic parking lots
<br>i like that you like it . the idea is not to take a walk to take the garbage
<br>it seems to me very ingenious! that the collection and transport of the garbage is done in the basement
<br>but we would also not have to rule out that , instead of doing it in the subway cars
<br>with this voting system on this web we do n't get the 54,000 support or pussy....................................................................................................................
<br>i agree , and it 's a shame you do n't have enough reception
<br>i do n't see the difficulty of lowering the garbage cans from the street to a platform in an elevator , putting it in a wagon at 3 in the morning
<br>it 's the first time that it was possible to do it and in an ideal world it happened more often

 it 's very true, in my daughter's school that is public, from 3-6 years all class material is paid in cooperative and the truth that works great, and above all children learn to share and care for class material. from 6 nose if they go with chips . 
<br>  all schools use the same. Free books should be licensed as cc by-sa, and accept the participation of independent experts, professionals in education . 
<br> the books do not change from one year to another. what less than 4 years with the same books?? being realistic, the contents cannot vary so much. I agree with the line of argument of re-using the books. in any case it would have to pay its amortization to acquire new books of updated editions . 
<br>  the cost would be paid in terms of taxes instead of in the bookstore, but at the end of anyway our money would end up in the hands of the editorials. by removing the disqualifications of both I agree, all that
<br> change.. I don't says it 's not necessary to use text books as it is being done to learn and less to change editorials every two years. everyone who pays taxes should be entitled to free books and should not discriminate if you study in a public or private school. of course . 
<br>  I could create a proposal on this, but I am not a specialist in training and didactics .

<br>what should inescapably be done is to reuse textbooks, and that all schools use the same. textbooks, .
<br>if they go with chips and very few books so this should do in many .
<br>the 'elephant in the room' are the editorials and their practices. and their practices. are practices. and practices. 'the : the educational authorities should create and make available to the educational community a bank of digital and printable resources .
<br>another : it 's true that a more sustainable material, within the reach of all budgets, and books that they change every single thing) seems more appropriate
<br>he says it would have to pay its amortization to acquire new books of updated editions .
<br>it should be like everything else, depending on income, but for that there are also scholarships... .it is being done to learn and less to change editorials every two .
<br>!, besides there are places to take away...i do not think it will touch .
<br>that someone was proposing
<br>i support this request, we have to end the marketing of children's .
<br>this, is a brilliant idea, and in fact i could create a proposal on this, but i am not a specialist in training and didactics .<br>

<br> a bank of digital and printable resources would cover the pedagogical contents established by the law so they could be used autonomously by each teacher . 
<br>  it is true that a more sustainable material, within the reach of all budgets, and books should be returned in perfect condition. I think the same should be done with textbooks and library books: . 
<br> the rental system is being done to learn and less to change editorials every two years. everyone who pays taxes should be entitled to free books and should not discriminate if you study in a public or private school. of course . 
<br>  there will come a time when those who do not pay a service for their payroll and those with a higher payroll just pay and receive nothing.or for everyone or tax relief .

free books should be extended to all types of centres covered by public centres
<br>it is absurd to shift the (current) cost of parents' textbooks to the city hall
<br>what makes the most sense is to develop/suffraise independently (i.e. ) without bias) an editorial line of school books
<br>as a teacher and mother i very much agree with you that publishing is a business in my opinion excessive
<br>i think that the educational authorities should create and make available to the educational community a bank of digital and or printable resources that would cover the pedagogical contents established by the law
<br>i find it difficult that with the taxes that we pay public schools can take charge of that expense
<br>it turns out that investing in education is everyone 's business
<br>it is not necessary to use text books as it is being done to learn and less to change editorials every two years
<br>anyone who pays taxes should be entitled to free books and should not discriminate if you study in a public or private school

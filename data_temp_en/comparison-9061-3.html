 street art. madrid free of paints that the money spent on cleaning them would be better used in social works.. you can give them guidelines to paint and not, it is something that they are doing many shops in their locks and doors . 
<br>  I insist that I speak of public areas, such as the walls under the bridges of roads, that are full of painted and could be improved, or facades of ruined buildings, . 
<br> I think that the only solution to the painted ones is in the long term and it is about "education in respect", the rest are only momentary. cleaning, costed with money either public or of each neighbor, until another enlightened one who thinks he is a great creative and condemns us to see his "art". what some shops do, paying for them to paint their closures . 
<br>  psychological analysis. We'd have to educate them and increase the fines. Besides, a mafia who's dedicated to painting shop doors in exchange for doing something nice and not a scribble.
<br> I is a pity that you can not attach photos in the proposals because it is really worth seeing them, but I have attached the location of an institute in my neighbourhood . 
<br>  the change is brutal, now the facades of the schools and nurseries have motivating drawings and phrases. and some walls have yielded to associations to decorate them every x time .

<br>the intention is not to have to spend money on cleaning painted and have fewer areas that are either a horror or that are simply a signature

<br>a proposal added to the list of unrepealed proposals
<br>sure, that yesterday i saw on the tv that they have invited several international artists to paint the walls of the old industrial tobacco ship in the gloriette of ambassadors
<br>the only permissible space for the shrimps called "graphiters " to paint, is their own house

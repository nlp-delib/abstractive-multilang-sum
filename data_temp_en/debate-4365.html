- it would have to be 600 thousand. not for drinking alcohol, as if you take sulfuric acid, who cares?. but for sluts, pigs and troublemakers. I can say it louder but no clearer..
<br>- you should learn to have respect for people and not to speak without knowing things well. everyone has failures and no one intends to dirty or upset or bother. so before talking bad about people understand the word empathy. a 600 penalty is crazy, a punishment is something normal but having worse sanctions for drinking than for smoking you or hitting someone on the street is something disproportionate so learn to complain about what really is wrong and not try to talk bad because it is something.
<br>- the fact of drinking on the street does not mean that I am setting up any jail, in the same way that it does not imply being a slut and a pig. polemics aside, my question is as follows: would a rise in sanctions really eradicate alcohol consumption on the public road? in my opinion at all. is more, in many cases the only thing that is achieved is totally the opposite..
<br>- Thank you for such qualifications.
<br>- you really don't have anything else to do? you have commented in my post and in this practically the same thing. doesn't it seem a little sad? personal opinions about your indecent person aside I have to add that a person drinks on the street doesn'T make him a hustler and a slut, he should have a beer on the public street should be perfectly accepted at this point.
<br>- if you're bitter, don't pay for it with the others.
<br>- I totally agree. It's an excessive amount of 600. I understand that something needs to be done to avoid the unchecked bottle and that the leisure areas should be left clean. It seems to me that social work, so the punishment does not fall on the parents alone, but on the cause of the annoyances.
<br>- you'd better go to college and learn how to empathize:).
<br>- Neil, I recommend reading my proposals, I have now helped a young man to plead, to appeal the sanction, at this time this pending resolution in the administrative court of madrid against madrid sant√©. I am against the imposition of unfair fines for drinking alcohol publicly. I leave you one of my proposals in case you want to support it.
<br>- I'll leave you this proposal in case you're interested.<br>

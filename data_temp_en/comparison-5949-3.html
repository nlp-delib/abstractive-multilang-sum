 Good but, : we pay more to the company that does the service of taking out and putting the cubes because the person who comes has to charge night time . 
<br>  we have only two 2 hours to lower the garbage? by live done the sidewalks are so narrow that you do not empty cabs with a wheelchair and the baby cars carry them on the road. we could take all the garbage to your house . 
<br> the sidewalks. I is the most viable option, other than that you can lower the trash at any time of the day . 
<br>  the only viable solution would be the installation of underground containers, which require a certain investment, while we will have to live with the buckets, at least this way . 
<br> the urban cleaning service is deficient. in other cities much care is taken to clean the container areas. I . 
<br>  the cohe has more priority than a person, they do have to have the right to park, even if people can't even go through the sidewalks.There are solutions, limit parking areas .

it is as important as the safety of a city or health for people
<br>if we have insanity in a city we run a lot of risk in all aspects
<br>the points to deal with about cleaning are quite interesting
<br>there is no need to make exaggerated investments
<br>i would see it the most viable option for that you can lower the trash at any time of the day and encourage recycling
<br>it is true that there is no spare space to park , but to enter the portal with a suitcase i have seen and desired them because neither between car and car could pass or walk
<br>i as a neighbor of the center (mill fire) ) the only viable solution would be the installation of underground containers , which require a certain investment  while we will have to live with the buckets
<br>the pockets of dirt are such simply because the urban cleaning service is deficient
<br>in other cities much care is taken to clean the container areas
<br>i believe that there is no desire to make life easier for people and that does not give a vote

Yes because it was going to be the showy madrid center with general containers to store garbage at any time of the day with garbage cubes on the sidewalks.. of course it is uncomfortable about the cube(s).. yes sir, very good idea!. make on the roads that have parking for vehicles a space of 90 cm wide, in front of the portals, with two goes (
<br> in many cities and capitals of province. The investment has to do it as has already been done already years ago in many provinces and cities. greetings. the urban service is poor and the urban population is even more deficient. I believe that there is no desire to make life easier for people and that does not give a vote. On the contrary, the car gives a lot of votes.

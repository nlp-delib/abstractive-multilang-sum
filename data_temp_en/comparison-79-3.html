 currently only used cooking oil can be recycled at clean points, on many occasions away from homes. bringing it closer to neighboring communities would facilitate recycling. I recycle it and every time I fill the bottle it is my job to take it to a specific clean spot . 
<br>  those containers for oil are already in other municipalities. I think it would be easier to increase the number of mobile clean points . 
<br> it's is a group of entrepreneurs who collect the oil used in the communities of free neighbors. they run with the expense of the containers they carry and collect them. they enter in "other time, another planet". the cooking oil you can leave it at the clean spots in each neighborhood. . 
<br> the clean points. This proposal does not make much sense, I think. the problem that many would use to make oil from cars, . 
<br>  clean points are not places of easy access. it is not to bother to go to them, it is that it can be an excursion and even so without a car . 
<br>  clean points mobile have restricted schedules. is something that exists, moreover, in many smaller cities and with easier access to clean points . 
<br> the oil pollutes even more than plastic and glass and in all homes it is made use of. because not create a special service . 
<br>  the collection of furniture. I think it is very good idea that in the supermarkets there are containers of collection of oil, if not currently possible . 
<br> the city hall of madrid. is advancing at a rate that exceeds 14 times to Greece. poverty and exclusion in Spain with 13.4 million people at risk of exclusion in 2014 (29.2% of the Spanish population) . 
<br>  the city website, ordered by districts or located on a map to be easier to recycle. the proposal is interesting but I fear that we are forgetting issues that are priorities for the lives of many families without resources . 
<br> the container recycling glass, bricks, etc. no longer know what to do with so much pot with used oil because I refuse to throw it down the drain. it would be interesting to install containers in municipal markets . 
<br>  they are also collected in some communities of neighbors. and the mobile clean points have a super varied schedule: in the afternoon others... .

currently only used cooking oil can be recycled at clean points
<br>it seems to me that those containers for oil are already in other municipalities
<br>i think it would be easier to increase the number of mobile clean points and the timetables of them
<br>it 's not a bad idea david.................................... is going to the market almost every day
<br>i have to put the oil in water bottles and close them well and to waste
<br>proposals proposing the burial of containers:of course
<br>the collection of oil is already done at the clean points
<br>this proposal does not make much sense
<br>too many companies that do it to get biodiesel
<br>the proposal seems to me to be appropriate because these types of containers are also used in many cities
<br>usually in places like supermarkets it can be more dangerous) and it is really the way to encourage something as polluting as oil not to end up in general garbage
<br>i do not think that appealing to the laziness of citizens to recycle is an excuse not to support the proposal
<br>the clean points are not enough alternative
<br>they are good for throwing tvs , other types of oils or polluting waste
<br>but for something as daily and abundant as the oil in the kitchens of our homes and restaurants
<br>many people are not even aware that throwing oil into the drain is polluting
<br>it is absurd to have to go out there (by car ) and therefore polluting) to throw 5l of oil
<br>i do n't know what to do with so much pot with used oil because i refuse to throw it down the drain . it would be interesting to install containers in municipal markets and large areas
<br>i have the nearest fixed clean spot fifteen minutes from home walking and on the coast, and in my neighborhood there are people who have it much further away
<br>i would like to invite you to notify all your supporters by notification that they visit the proposal that proposals over 100 can not be deleted each year with more than 100 support

 neighborhoods or schools. This is a very interesting proposal. I am from Gijon and there the city council for years has installed containers at the entrance of many supermarkets, so it is very easy to recycle the oil: completion of the works of the aquatic center: very important this proposal. Votes this citizen proposal in the following link:. anti-Graphic.
<br> to be followed: Here you all are: if my village (mountijo -ba) has them, why not madrid? until now, I have to put the oil in water bottles, close them well and to waste. if you care about the environment, you would also support this proposal. I also encourage you to learn to make homemade soap with the oil used to wash dishes, etc. is very easy
<br> it is not to bother to go to them, it is that it can be an excursion and even so without a car it is quite complicated to get to them. thanks for the information, but if you look at those clean spots in each neighborhood are itinerant, and their schedules are quite restricted. these things can also accumulate and go to throw them when we have a few. Nor do you need to go
<br> in the neighborhoods themselves. with the collection of furniture. I like your proposal for your environmental interest. it is a great idea.. a good one. a greeting. and a supermarket. a clean spot.. the clean spots are quite far away from the neighborhoods. clean spots. clean spots from the neighborhood....
<br> :). Good morning north-health. I allow myself the freedom to "adopt" your proposal.. I agree with you, in the center, for example, the clean points work only 2 hours and each day are in one place, so it seems a vague because you do not want to go with the trash on the bus to take it to throw it, especially if you don't have your own vehicle
<br>. and the mobile clean points have a super varied schedule: in the morning a few days, in the afternoon others... and that only those of a district. but if you go next door, you have even more scope of schedule. I think it is very necessary just like the container recycling glass, bricks, etc. I don't have any news in madrid of any, and less in moratal

<br>the problem that many would use to make oil from cars, is a different point, too many companies that do it to get biodiesel add another proposal please
<br>propose to collect and transport the garbage through the subway .
<br>the proposal should not wait to have enough .the : oil not to end up in general garbage (at best) or directly in pipes .
<br>the laziness of citizens to recycle is an excuse not to support the proposal, but if it is its motive, .
<br>following its logic , taking into account the feasibility would be absurd .
<br>lastly add that not many years ago there was only a bucket of garbage for everything. .

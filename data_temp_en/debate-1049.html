- That's a must.
<br>- totally in accordance with the same as
<br>- count on my vote:).
<br>- count on my vote and all my impetus to defend this proposal.
<br>- Thank you gabriela. It takes momentum to make madrid more habitable. of all we will get it. a greeting.
<br>- voted.
<br>- it seems to me wrong that proposals (as laudable as they may be) be sliced into another unrelated one. I think it distorts this good tool. let's be civic.
<br>- madrid needs this. all the cases of pedestrianization of the center I know have resulted in more lively and attractive cities for tourists. it is not difficult to imagine how much the city would improve a great pedestrian path with space for banks, bicycles and green areas that project shade.
<br>There are examples of cities that have improved a lot as a plague where it is now a pleasure to walk and in Europe or what to say, you just have to see big cities like berna, munich, amsterdam....
<br>- Thank you, we'll all make it.
<br>- Why? It seems wrong to share ideas. To me this is not a competition.
<br>- For those of you who are thinking about it, you knew that 1 in 8 deaths in the world are related to environmental pollution.
<br>- Pope Francis i: addressing climate change is a moral issue.
<br>- 5 cities around the world that want to stop using cars the first: madrid.
<br>- sky in Beijing before and after 2 weeks without 2.5 mm of cars.
<br>- September 27th, Paris will be for a day a city without cars!
<br>- reducing madrid pollution is a task of all, particularly I am one of those who think it is better to look for alternatives before banning, but as long as something has to be implemented, I support your action, here is another proposal that seeks to reduce the pollution of vehicles without harming anyone.
<br>- I like your proposal. count on my vote. a greeting!!.
<br>- this would be achieved 100% if the conspicuous apr was implemented for the central area that we have been fighting for so long by the neighbors of the center. it is not necessary to pedestrianize because in doing so the locals and the bars would request to put more terraces in the streets that we already have when we have the necessary width to apply for the license. with the prevention of the entry into the area to the non-residents with their cars, problems of noise, pollution, parking for the residents and quality of life in general would be solved. apr for the whole central zone of madrid is absolutely necessary and for this there is a proposal created to which you can vote as to this one: thank you.
<br>- with my support. We could unify the proposal into one and add votes.
<br>- I am not alone in this. I belong to the association of neighbors of center and the rest do not agree with the subject of pedestrianization. We have been on the subject for many years and that would give wings to the restorers of the area that have always been overprotected by the city for economic interests. Let us hope that with now madrid the thing changes, but at the moment they are not very willing to it, they continue to give long... already comment.
<br>- I'm sorry, I think I was wrong about the tab. In some places there's been real abuse. Sorry.
<br>- I think it's great, but I would point out the fact of the time of the freight vans. I think that people who work with a vehicle, either to distribute goods, as another task, would give a little more time of three hours. otherwise forward with it, those who live there we will thank..
<br>- to your expression: "No one comes to the center of madrid in a private car because you can't park."I go to the centre of Madrid by car, and if, you can park, that's why there are public parking lots and many times on the street, paying parking meter.Sorry,I don't support your proposal,I'll continue to go downtown by car.
<br>- totally agree. We would have to polish the proposal, but I think it is necessary to decongest the center of madrid. a greeting!!.
<br>- people like you remind me of those who resisted when they introduced the anti-smoking law. If we had listened to them, you could still smoke even on the planes. I'm sorry, but I wish they wouldn't get away with it either this time.
<br>- the problem you comment on the terraces is easily solved: do not grant so much license for terraces or change the municipal regulations. as far as pedestrianization is concerned, I think it makes a pedestrianized street more pleasant than with sidewalks and sidewalks..
<br>- totally in agreement with you, mime.
<br>- Oh, my God.
<br>- Why don't you put all the links in one comment, thank you.
<br>- the best of all is that some of those who don't want to leave the car threw pests out of the tobacco. that's the law of the funnel. I smoked years ago and when I was arguing with others about the matter I set him a very clear example. you can lock yourself in a room and look at three work packages with closed windows and after a few hours you'll come out with your eyes going and your throat taken. in the same room turn on the engine of a car and in minutes you're dead. tobacco was satanized, but the cars weren't interested in talking.The problem is that the government team that casts itself against the drivers loses all the elections because they are an immense majority.
<br>- the cell phone corrector has played me three bad past, jeje....
<br>- very good example. people are not aware because they are lazy and this makes them not want to leave the car nor, and much more worrying, think. thanks to God there are some people who think like you. thank you!.
<br>- I hope that traffic will soon be restricted in the madrid centre, so that the clams unable to give up the car have to catch public transport by nose..
<br>I'll see what happens to the car and the madrid center... that's another topic than smoking.
<br>- lazy is to go on public transport that you don't have to think and almost walk, if I go by car I have to drive the vehicle, with which I am not stopped or much less, and it is used much more the mind, especially if I am going to the center, and I need to look for parking...that if it is to exercise, both body, as mind.Yes you don ́t like cars in the center of madrid, since you have no options, like going to live to valdebebas, or to montecarlo, or the countryside, it will be because there are few rural lands in Spain....
<br>I think you don't have a very clear definition of clam, but well, following the definition you have given me, I answer you.It's the one who, being able to take the car, is going on a bicycle in the month of January, hiding, not contaminating, or the one that gets into a subway car, at 8 in the morning, packed with people, oozing the sock next to him, able to go by car, or being waiting, a bus that never arrives, for 20 minutes more the journey to your destination, when you plant yourself in 15 minutes, and without passing any heat or cold.Well, for me that's to be clam, or better said, to be unpractical....
<br>- because it's a shame that madrid is the first... we could already be the first in other things, and not in assholes.
<br>On the other hand, I don't see what the relationship between tobacco and cars is. Cars contaminate, yes, but I do not know anyone who hasn't needed to use the car several times. The car sometimes solves problems. Tobacco, create them. I think the comparison is absurd, and the comment too.
<br>- according to you karmela. those who so much cry for pedestrianization, it is because they have not pedestrianized their neighborhood and have not been able to check the supposed "advantages" such as: that nobody wants to give you a package that you receive by mail and you have to fold at their schedules (if you can), that the bars fill the street with chairs and tables, and the street goes from being everyone, to being only them. that it fills with bars of drinks and discos and drunks on the weekend throwing up through the portals. I do not like cars, but I prefer them before all that.
<br>- Do you know what you're saying??? you don't know. not granting new licenses would already bring queue, because of the aggravation compared to all those who have them. and withdrawing the terrace permits, that is, the private appropriation of the public ground to the caradures of the bar owners, implies a direct and tidal confrontation in sight. because something else will not be the hoteliers, but bronchi and tears. they complain if it rains and if it doesn't rain too.
<br>- that is a well-made and sensible proposal. If you encourage or give priority to electric cars throughout the city, it will be a very effective measure against pollution and will not affect the freedom of movement. here many fill the mouth to pedestrianize and restrict traffic in the center. but I would like those who ask, do it first in your neighborhood and see the consequences.
<br>- I don't think it's wrong, but I see a problem: do you have no problems receiving packages, moving furniture to your home, etc.? because I every time I have to receive something, they make me a thousand problems.
<br>- to pedestrianize nothing. that that then take advantage of the "jets" of the bar owners to become the owners of the street: fill it all with chairs, tables and furniture that "mark" the border of their private property (which before was that of all). I am against any pedestrianization, while there are caradura hoteliers in this city... that seem to exist many years.
<br>- you show intolerance and rudeness so I'm not going to keep talking to you. You're upset with the tobacco and my car, which we're going to do....
<br>- it seems to me that the intolerant is you, that you do not admit contrary opinions. and you show arrogance and ignorance. by example, you claim that it bothers my car. where do you get that I have car?. you make free assumptions, like your arguments.
<br>- simple... and much is you. Do you not have enough examples of pedestrian streets in madrid that in your day sold it as a benefit to the Madridns and then you became private property dr lis nares of the area?Do you not know that invasion and appropriation dr the street is a desire of cadi all the hoteliers?Did you ignore that pedestrianizing the street, under the pretext of improving life to all, is a meta excuse and a commercial strategy to end up taking hold of it and regret leaving a minimum space to the travellers?Are you living on Tuesday not to see what happens in front of your noses year after year?
<br>- all the cases of pedestrianization of the center that I see every day is that there is no longer the public space pirque sevlo have taken over the owners of the bars.It is even allowed to put pots and barriers to "mark" their private territory (before it was public).This is not a more lively city. this is a scandal of privatization of the public ground.
<br>- Mr. Simplón, who goes from the list, tell me: all these years that have proliferated pedestrian streets and that have been systematically invaded by chairs and tables... were there no ordinances or laws? was there no city council those years?. has bemosoles that in ignorant call me pusilanim to someone.
<br>- and add to my comment: you can insult again, that I won't answer you any more, because I don't want to prioritize your proposals with comments.
<br>- one thing is to restrict traffic in the center by creating areas of residential priority and another very different is to pedestrianize it. pedestrianization in madrid has to date had perverse effects for residents, and the only thing that has been achieved with it is the proliferation of terraces and the increase of acoustic pollution..
<br>- it's a little short for my taste, but something is something.
<br>- I think it's smarter to set up the apr throughout the center, allows residents and distributors access and decongests the center for greater pedestrian enjoyment. I understand that the great road can't be set up apr zone for between the week, but on weekends, from Friday to 18:00 until Monday at 6:00 in the morning the cameras could be activated. It would also help the fact of encouraging the dissuasive parking in the madrid entrances and increase the frequency of public transport at those points. But well, that would be too civic for a city like madrid, although late or temprando will have to go raising awareness to the people that you can not get to the center with the car at the door. I when I see those jams on the weekends to get to center I wonder how there are people willing to waste so much time and stress instead of enjoying giving a walk. but of course, this is a personal opinion without importance. a greeting and luck..
<br>- I am a neighbor of the Latina and I am even the real nostrils of not being able to park and having to endure a traffic hell in the area. so I support this motion including all the neighborhoods of the historic madrid. any European city that is valued have regulated traffic in the historical central area in a much more efficient and effective way than here. another thing that seems to me outrageous is that the city council has removed places of resident in favor of others of long-term parking on the coast of the Vega where we could park before and now not. also I am outraged that there is a whole full sidewalk of places reserved for the nunciature and the church of San Miguel in the street sacrament!!!!!!!!!! is it that the cures have more right than the rest?????? and if not, that parking places for residents are built at normal prices, right now a parking place in the latina is quoted at 180 euros, if you find any....
<br>- according to you. the problem is not to pedestrianize a street (it only brings advantages such as lower contamination, lower noise, etc.) the issue is limited to a correct regularization of pedestrian areas in order to give priority to the interest of the traveler or resident. it is not so difficult... it only takes will.
<br>- I'm from the hostelry and I think you're wrong, if you put a schedule on the terraces and a number of tables you could live in a great way, we live from the hotelry and if we don't have a terrace they wouldn't be able to eat 3 families that we have in charge, we're not crying, if it doesn't rain, and they won't eat many families.
<br>- no ma'am. we are not wrong. it's more, I would say we are too right, because we suffer it day after day. the hard face and the boldness of the hoteliers is not a problem now, but always. don't come with them putting schedules, or limiting the tables, and other mandangas, that we already know plenty of how most people go through the lining those limitations and, as the cops say, "I'm not going to go underground to measure the space." look, we're more than fed up with that public space, which is of all (my also) being permanently occupied by tables chairs, furniture and armatosts. How about if I make a parcel in the middle of the street, the fence and I put a social hall for my friends? if you have that privilege, I also want it. and you say that they are not crying, and the first thing that makes it lie that they "eat 3 families of that". if I don ́t generate enough income without disturbing and invading others, think about it.
<br>- I support this proposal.
<br>- taxis should not have access unless they are electric, this regulation already exists, but it is taxis and distributors that do not comply with the rules. exceeding speed, not respecting pedestrians when not separating them. and distribution, under strict schedule, with a maximum duration of 5 hours and weekends prohibited.
<br>- hello karmela: you could pass me a mail address of the association neighbors of the center of madrid. I do not agree anything with you. the apr areas, seem to me completely insufficient. these areas are not clear about who has priority on the road. I live in the neighborhood letters and this is horrific. the cars that circulate through them, that are not few, go at all speed, painting you all day and giving you scares of death. even in the vegetable street that is pedestrian, the cars always send on the pedestrian and this would not have to be so. the regulations on pedestrian zones, apr zones, semi-peath zones, is not clear. the article 45 of the law of urban mobility I suppose that it would have to apply in these areas, but neither the agents themselves know it. if indeed in the areas after they circulate less cars but only that, it is also a danger to swim quietly. the only real way is that the pedestrian has priority in front of the car.
<br>- the proposal is interesting but I fear that we are forgetting issues that are priorities for the lives of many families without resources that cannot feed their children. I remind you that Spain is the country of the ocde where inequality has advanced the most during the crisis. Inequality in Spain is advancing at a rate that exceeds 14 times to Greece. poverty and exclusion in Spain have increased alarmingly in recent years, with 13.4 million people at risk of exclusion in 2014 (29.2% of the Spanish population) as the report "an economy serving 1%" made public in 2016 by Oxfam intermon. On the other hand, we are waiting for us to apply 10 billion euros in cuts from Europe. we can continue to obviate this issue, think that nothing happens but now is the time to put in place actions against poverty:
<br>- it is essential for the city to recover the citizen life giving greater space to the citizen and less protagonism to the road traffic. wider sidewalks / exclusive parking for residents / more pedestrianized streets / more trees / recovery of public spaces for the citizen<br>

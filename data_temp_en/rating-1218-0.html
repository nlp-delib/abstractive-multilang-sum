- it would be necessary to force the motorcycles to park in areas intended for that use. creating them throughout the city, on roads or in areas of the sidewalk where they do not bother. the municipal ordinance establishes that on sidewalks of a certain width they can park, but this depends on each road and pedestrian circulation. to start the police could fine those who fail in the way of parking the motorcycle or do it in narrow sidewalks. also in sidewalks-bikes, I have to invade the sidewalk every two by three, harassing the pedestrians, because they park me in my area of passage.
<br>- the current system by which motorcycles walk and park on sidewalks, is an authentic violation of the rights of travellers.
<br>- I will not vote for your proposal for several reasons: if the parking rules on the sidewalks were met, it would not open any problem of coexistence. respect the width of the sidewalk to be able to park, the position parallel to the road, separated from bus stops and access to buildings and pedestrian positions, and not the opposite as is done now. also try to understand the problem dd share the space between motorcycles and cars, unfortunately quite complicated, when parking on the road I have found myself several times the motorcycle pulled by pushing a car while parking.
<br>- of course the optimal solution that pleases drivers and pedestrians is that they have the necessary parking for them. That if tb. should pay like cars to park, or do they not pollute?.
<br>- I think that the roads must be at least 3 meters wide so that the motorcycles can park, and we should support that there are more motorcycles than cars, because it is also less polluting for madrid and facilitates mobility, but if someone does not comply with that regulation, it should be sanctioned.
<br>- I will not vote for your proposal.I understand that the 'priority' of drivers is to park their vehicle. with the enormous difficulty existing in our city to get parking space for motorcycles you will understand that your request is far from reasonable.By the way, in amsterdam as an example, the pedestrian is the 'lower' part on the sidewalks, in which bicycles have priority.It is only an example.I share with you our need (peathons) to walk along the unhindered sidewalks that prevent it, yet friend I understand most usefully sharing spaces.a hug.
<br>- Maybe you haven't thought about it, but I've seen a poor blind man literally stamp himself against a motorcycle that was on a sidewalk... at last!
<br>- what do you do in amsterdam, the truth is that I think it's great, now, I don't know what it has to do.... the sidewalks have been built for pedestrians, I think? and the motorcycles for roads I say, don ÃÅt I?, because the parkings for them are made for them on the road and not on sidewalks, come on, I say no?.but of course with people like you who give more priority to motor vehicles running on the pavements to people who in many cases are older, with handicaps and who are overwhelmed with a lot of obstacles to which now by civicism (as you claim) we have to share tb. with motor vehicles. no more because......flipo with their contribution and with their embrace.
<br>- the regulations governing the parking of motorcycles on the sidewalk, clearly specifies how they should be on the public road. The problem is that many drivers do not comply with this law. This rule should not be amended, enforced, with penalties if necessary.
<br>- fully agree however as soon as the regulations that are sanctioned are not changed, but please the sidewalks for pedestrians and motorcycles on the road...... that the regulations be changed.<br>

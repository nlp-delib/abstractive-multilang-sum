I remember that in my school, when we were little (because then they took it off) we had a garden and we ate what we grew. There was no child who didn't know where the food came from. There is no right to be paid real fortunes for the meals of our children and/or elders.
<br>Poverty and exclusion in Spain have increased alarmingly in recent years. Inequality in Spain is advancing at a rate that exceeds 14 times to Greece. 13.4 million people at risk of exclusion in 2014 (29.2% of the Spanish population) as the report "an economy serving 1%" made public in 2016 by Oxfam.

 totally agree. there is no right to be paid real fortunes for the meals of our children and/or elders . 
<br>  food mess, nutritionally incomplete and whose benefit only affects the turn contract, rather than the health of those who have to eat it. I remember that in my school, when we were little (because then they took it off) we had a garden . 
<br> totally in agreement that the bodies of municipal ownership follow ecological criteria, proximity and social economy in their public purchases in the services of school dining in children's schools . 
<br>  the food only costs 1 euro per day and the rest is taken by the staff of the dining and care.. a school can have its own kitchen or bring food from outside .

 only need will. it is not important, but it is absolutely necessary. to educate the most small people in responsible consumption, local, sustainable, etc. should be one of the main tasks, but the one that most. we will get it. thank you very much promoters. What luck. What school was it? What luck? What school did it? what luck? How luck. How lucky. What schools were it?
<br> we love them close. I offer you another way to generate employment and help families without resources. Considering that in Madrid, independent food banks operate have only 4 employees and 450 volunteers, the creation of a municipally run and public food bank would generate an environment number of 500 jobs for the coordination of the collection, storage and delivery of food to families with no resources. the proposal is interesting but I fear that we are forgetting

 agree. There is technically possible, and at almost the same price (less than 5 euros extra . 
<br>  it is not important but the health of the small people is fundamental and with that you do not play or bargain: we are what we eat.. is a very appropriate and intelligent measure from many points of view: . 
<br> the food only costs 1 euro per day and the rest is taken by the staff of the dining and care.. a school can have its own kitchen or bring food from outside . 
<br>  if one takes his own food to eat there the price is almost equal, 3.5 euros! .

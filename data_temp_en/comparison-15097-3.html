 I I : I I would propose to put clean points in the ccs because for them it is a complaint . 
<br>  the city council can save costs. without taking personal, they can extend the hours of the municipal staff or hire more to collect what is deposited in shopping centers. . 
<br>  the proposal also focuses on obtaining a benefit for recycling. that is why I disagree. it must be recycled . 
<br> I Yes, : if you leave it on the street, case of botellon, there are people need to get a performance to those bottles and also for the sake of cleaning the streets. berl√≠n, an example. and it is a city more or less like madrid. I very much agree with any proposal that improves and increases recycling but...I will share my personal opinion I find no sense in paying an additional amount for each package .

i do not think it 's a profit to recycle and to recover the cost of that packaging that we were previously charged when we purchased it
<br>the solution is called returnable containers , especially for glass bottles . when you return them to the machine they return the price of the helmet

<br>this happens in many countries of europe and also if you leave it on the street
<br>there are people need to get a performance to those bottles and also for the sake of cleaning the streets

 the city council can save money. without taking personal, they can hire more to collect what is deposited in shopping malls. it is for convenience. if it is recycled more, it is good for madrid. moreover, the ccs can save costs. in brick there is currently one of electrical material, batteries and bulbs and ** is filled to overflow** every week and they leave things on the ground because
<br> if you do it for money or for conviction.. I see it as an incentive too, so people will be interested and in the future will be a custom acquired, that is done more by the fact of contributing to the environment than by the money received!. I think that in the end we have to recycle by conscience to be civic and educate, on the contrary to fine the one who does not, especially if they

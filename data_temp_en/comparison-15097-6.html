I think very well this project. even if they don't pay, they have to put more containers in shopping malls. in brick there is currently one of electrical material, batteries and bulbs and ** is filled to overflow** every week.

<br> if you do it for money or for conviction.. I see it as an incentive too, so people will be interested and in the future will be a custom acquired, that is done more by the fact of contributing to the environment than by the money received!.

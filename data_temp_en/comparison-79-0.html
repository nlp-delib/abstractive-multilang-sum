 currently only used cooking oil can be recycled at clean points, on many occasions away from homes. bringing it closer to neighboring communities would facilitate recycling. I recycle it and every time I fill the bottle it is my job to take it to a specific clean spot . 
<br>  those containers for oil are already in other municipalities. I think it would be easier to increase the number of mobile clean points . 
<br> it's is a group of entrepreneurs who collect the oil used in the communities of free neighbors. they run with the expense of the containers they carry and collect them. they enter in "other time, another planet". the cooking oil you can leave it at the clean spots in each neighborhood. . 
<br> the clean points. This proposal does not make much sense, I think. the problem that many would use to make oil from cars, . 
<br>  clean points are not places of easy access. it is not to bother to go to them, it is that it can be an excursion and even so without a car . 
<br>  clean points mobile have restricted schedules. is something that exists, moreover, in many smaller cities and with easier access to clean points . 
<br> the oil pollutes even more than plastic and glass and in all homes it is made use of. because not create a special service . 
<br>  the collection of furniture. I think it is very good idea that in the supermarkets there are containers of collection of oil, if not currently possible . 
<br> the city hall of madrid. is advancing at a rate that exceeds 14 times to Greece. poverty and exclusion in Spain with 13.4 million people at risk of exclusion in 2014 (29.2% of the Spanish population) . 
<br>  the city website, ordered by districts or located on a map to be easier to recycle. the proposal is interesting but I fear that we are forgetting issues that are priorities for the lives of many families without resources . 
<br> the container recycling glass, bricks, etc. no longer know what to do with so much pot with used oil because I refuse to throw it down the drain. it would be interesting to install containers in municipal markets . 
<br>  they are also collected in some communities of neighbors. and the mobile clean points have a super varied schedule: in the afternoon others... .

<br>he says it 's my job to take it to a clean spot that catches me very far from home .
<br>the idea that i started a week ago, but nothing happens, as long as you get great.the only thing i advise you to edit .is very easy, recycle oil , '' says oil .
<br>city council trucks are located in certain areas .
<br>the works of the aquatic center thank you very .
<br>if you care about the environment, you would also support this .
<br>encourage you to make homemade soap with the oil used to wash dishes, .proposals proposing the burial of containers:of course, the collection of oil already done at the clean .
<br>this proposal does not make much sense, i think. .
<br>it is not to bother to go to them, it can be an excursion .
<br>the problem that many would use to make oil from cars, is a different point, too many companies that do it to get biodiesel add another proposal please
<br>propose to collect and transport the garbage through the subway .
<br>the proposal should not wait to have enough .the : oil not to end up in general garbage (at best) or directly in pipes .
<br>the laziness of citizens to recycle is an excuse not to support the proposal, but if it is its motive, .
<br>following its logic , taking into account the feasibility would be absurd .
<br>lastly add that not many years ago there was only a bucket of garbage for everything. .
<br>i have lived in countries where not only glass was done by colors, .they : oil in the kitchens of our homes and restaurants (let's .

 the timetables of them.It would be containers that could be placed next to the organics, paper or glass. we care madrid. fully agree, . 
<br>  it is already operational. the closer housing is placed the more culture of recycling there will be. you pass a link of the city of Zaragoza. does not generate such a quantity of oils as to have to place another container . 
<br> david......is I are city council trucks that are located in certain areas according to a schedule and do the function of clean points . 
<br>  you can be useful Oh, my God. there is a group of entrepreneurs who collect the oil used in the communities of free neighbors. . 
<br> containers:of course, proposes to collect and transport the garbage through the subway network. . 
<br>  the proposal is not to bother to go to them, it is that it can be an excursion and even so without a car it is complicated to get to them. and clean points . 
<br>  if you look at those clean spots in each neighborhood are itinerant, and their schedules are quite restricted. . 
<br> clean way. I have lived in countries where not only glass was recycled, . 
<br>  it was not the only thing. good morning. seems like a tremendously necessary proposal. . 
<br>  the town council places a mobile recycling unit of sensitive products as can be oil, batteries . 
<br> the clean points are not enough alternative. they are good for throwing TVs, other types of recycling; . 
<br>  many cities have it, what are we waiting for?. with this could also contribute to the production of biodiesel. generating oil culture, we could lower the price of oil and pollute less... . 
<br> some communities of neighbors. and the mobile clean points have a super varied schedule: in the morning a few days, . 
<br>  if everything goes together, it would be interesting to install containers in municipal markets and areas. Oh, no longer know what to do with so much pot . 
<br>  there are many older people that would cost you a lot and couldn't. and less in moratal. the oil is a product of great use .

currently only used cooking oil can be recycled at clean points
<br>it seems to me that those containers for oil are already in other municipalities
<br>i think it would be easier to increase the number of mobile clean points and the timetables of them
<br>it 's not a bad idea david.................................... is going to the market almost every day
<br>i have to put the oil in water bottles and close them well and to waste
<br>proposals proposing the burial of containers:of course
<br>the collection of oil is already done at the clean points
<br>this proposal does not make much sense
<br>too many companies that do it to get biodiesel
<br>the proposal seems to me to be appropriate because these types of containers are also used in many cities
<br>usually in places like supermarkets it can be more dangerous) and it is really the way to encourage something as polluting as oil not to end up in general garbage
<br>i do not think that appealing to the laziness of citizens to recycle is an excuse not to support the proposal
<br>the clean points are not enough alternative
<br>they are good for throwing tvs , other types of oils or polluting waste
<br>but for something as daily and abundant as the oil in the kitchens of our homes and restaurants
<br>many people are not even aware that throwing oil into the drain is polluting
<br>it is absurd to have to go out there (by car ) and therefore polluting) to throw 5l of oil
<br>i do n't know what to do with so much pot with used oil because i refuse to throw it down the drain . it would be interesting to install containers in municipal markets and large areas
<br>i have the nearest fixed clean spot fifteen minutes from home walking and on the coast, and in my neighborhood there are people who have it much further away
<br>i would like to invite you to notify all your supporters by notification that they visit the proposal that proposals over 100 can not be deleted each year with more than 100 support

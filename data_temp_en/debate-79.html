- currently only used cooking oil can be recycled at clean points, on many occasions away from homes. bringing it closer to neighboring communities would facilitate recycling.
<br>- totally agree! I recycle it and every time I fill the bottle it is my job to take it to a specific clean spot that catches me very far from home and those who are mobile put them to some morning hours that many people come fatal to us, it seems to me that those containers for oil are already in other municipalities.
<br>- I think it would be easier to increase the number of mobile clean points and the timetables of them.It does not generate such a quantity of oils as to have to place another container in such limited areas today.
<br>- it is a very interesting proposal. in other municipalities it is already operational. the closer the housing is placed the more culture of recycling there will be. you pass a link of the city of Zaragoza. would be containers that could be placed next to the organics, paper or glass. we care madrid.
<br>- fully agree, to place an oil recycling container next to the glass and paper containers that we already have in madrid, as there are already in many other provinces.
<br>- which in Basque countries have this system in which the oil can be exchanged filled with another vacuum and which works very efficiently as an example of what can be valued for doing.
<br>- You have copied the idea that I started a week ago, but nothing happens, as long as you get great.The only thing I advise you to do is to edit the request and include as a request that it is essential that in order for an oil collection to be made in the most optimal way from the first day, that at least 10 containers are required in each district, thank you.
<br>- I recently discovered that I have a clean mobile spot on the parallel street where I live. but it does not help me much (or nothing) because it is a day a week and at an hour when I have already had to go to work.It would not be wrong to leave a container for it (which are usually smaller than those of glass or paper) near metro stations (in neighborhoods) or schools..
<br>- very important this proposal. I am from Gijon and there the city council for years has installed containers at the entrance of many supermarkets, so it is very easy to recycle the oil:
<br>- completion of the works of the aquatic center. Votes this citizen proposal in the following link:.
<br>- anti-Graphitis plan. Let's finish this lac:
<br>- We already have 1% of votes. We have a long way but we will get it. caring for madrid is taking care of ourselves..
<br>- it's not a bad idea david......is going to the market almost every day, and it doesn't cost to carry an oil boat as you're on your way.
<br>- if you care about the environment, you would also support this proposal.
<br>- a general and/or related:
<br>- I support this proposal and ask you to please support the completion of the works of the aquatic center Thank you very much!!
<br>- very good proposal! I also encourage you to learn to make homemade soap with the oil used to wash dishes, etc. is very easy, recycle oil and save.
<br>- hi!I don't know if you know the mobile clean points. I'm telling you because I had to throw several vinegar boats and I found this. They are city council trucks that are located in certain areas according to a schedule and do the function of clean points that are away from many neighborhoods. I have been lucky to catch one close to home. It's no better solution but you can be useful
<br>- Oh, my God.
<br>- there is a group of entrepreneurs who collect the oil used in the communities of free neighbors. they run with the expense of the containers they carry and collect them. they enter in "other time, another planet".
<br>- the cooking oil you can leave it at the clean spots in each neighborhood. that you do have to store it in a plastic container (any bottle of soda).
<br>- where one can know the place of the clean spot of each neighborhood. I have been looking for it and there is only the possibility of resorting to the clean spots roaming, with a reduced time once a week and on working hours that prevents, at least in my case, being able to eliminate it properly.
<br>- because they are starting to put them. near the park of s. isidro already put one before the summer. what happens is that sometimes it is and others not, maybe they take it to empty. but support.
<br>- a proposal to be followed:
<br>- Here you all are:
<br>- if my village (mountijo -ba) has them, why not madrid? until now, I have to put the oil in water bottles, close them well and to waste.
<br>At all the clean spots in madrid, you just have to bother to go to them.
<br>- I fully support the proposal, but I am not in favour of leaving containers on the streets, since it could be very dangerous for some reason (for vandalism or fortuitous) to set up pick-up points in shops, supermarkets and some public centres.
<br>- there are co-operatives that collect oil at home to make industrial soap etc. to collect oil personal attention is required because it depends on where it is brought by everyone and can be spilled and is dangerous, I am not sure about the containers unless they are very well designed ensuring that they are not dangerous, and in a clean way.
<br>- proposals proposing the burial of containers:-
<br>- of course, the collection of oil is already done at the clean points. This proposal does not make much sense, I think.
<br>- the problem that many would use to make oil from cars, which for that is a different point, too many companies that do it to get biodiesel add another proposal
<br>- please support this proposal:
<br>- Hello, I think ours are complementary. I propose to collect and transport the garbage through the subway network.
<br>- this proposal should not wait to have enough signatures. It is something too serious. even my people with 1000 inhabitants have 2 containers of oil!.
<br>- it has all the meaning of the world because clean points are not places of easy access. it is not to bother to go to them, it is that it can be an excursion and even so without a car it is quite complicated to get to them. and clean points mobile have restricted schedules. is something that exists, moreover, in many smaller cities and with easier access to clean points and that certainly makes it easier for people to really recycle used oil in a responsible way.
<br>- thanks for the information, but if you look at those clean spots in each neighborhood are itinerant, and their schedules are quite restricted. anyways thanks to the information.
<br>- then you would have to fill the streets with containers of all kinds, which is not feasible or logical. the logical thing is to have containers of the most usual things (organic, packaging, paper and glass) and for the rest have a center where you can leave the rest of things to recycle (i.e. a clean spot). the problem is that people are vague when it comes to recycling. Nor do you need to go to the clean spot every time we have to throw a stack or a light bulb. these things can also accumulate and go to throw them when we have a few. surely you and other people go further for other things, I don't think going to the neat spot of your district once a year (to say something) is for that.
<br>- Hi, I don't know if this proposal has gone ahead but in my neighborhood I've already seen two containers to collect oil, I live in the well and have placed them at the beginning of the interview park..
<br>- apart from the personal considerations about the type of things I invest my time in, which seems completely out of place in this debate, the proposal seems to me to be appropriate because these types of containers are also used in many cities, usually in places like supermarkets (in the street it can be more dangerous) and it is really the way to encourage something as polluting as oil not to end up in general garbage (at best) or directly in pipes and therefore in water. I do not think that appealing to the laziness of citizens to recycle is an excuse not to support the proposal, but if it is its motive, perfect. lastly add that not many years ago there was only a bucket of garbage for everything. following its logic and taking into account the feasibility would be absurd to add more cubes, it could be done all by clean way. I have lived in countries where not only glass was recycled, it was done by colors, and it was not the only thing.
<br>- good morning. seems like a tremendously necessary proposal. I did not know that there was already a similar one and then I created another similar one. I gave you the link because the description was quite complete and with explanatory links, in case you want to expand the explanation of this one and so get more support for a greeting and see if we get it between all of them.
<br>- there are containers in supermarkets so you don't have to move to a clean spot.
<br>- in benicassim, on Thursdays there is a market, the town council places a mobile recycling unit of sensitive products as can be oil, batteries etc. is very well thought out..
<br>- I liked your proposal for your environmental interest. I suggest you take a look at this one that you will definitely support...
<br>- it is not so simple especially for people who work and have no car of their own. the clean spots are quite far away from the neighborhoods. keep in mind that the oil pollutes even more than plastic and glass and in all homes it is made use of. because not create a special service as is done with the collection of furniture. I think it is very good idea that in the supermarkets there are containers of collection of oil, if not currently possible in the neighborhoods themselves.
<br>- I had also made this proposal, but I just saw that there is already this and others. as I think it is the one that has the most votes, I will withdraw mine. this is extremely important please. the clean points are not enough alternative. they are good for throwing TVs, other types of oils or polluting waste, etc., but for something as daily and abundant as the oil in the kitchens of our homes and restaurants (let's not forget everything that they produce too) not enough clean points because: many people are not even aware that throwing oil into the drain is polluting; others throw oil in a plastic container to organic waste, mixing different types of recycling; it is absurd to have to go out there (by car, and therefore polluting) to throw 5l of oil; and as many say, the clean travelling points have schedules that are inaccessible for many people. many cities have it, what are we waiting for?.
<br>- with this could also contribute to the production of biodiesel. generating oil recycling culture, we could lower the price of oil and pollute less... we are already slow!
<br>- citizens can inform the city council of the incidents and request recycling containers through the electronic headquarters of the city hall of madrid.
<br>- there are already clean points to leave the oil, I hope no one throws it through the sink... but it seems good to me, give more facilities so that we can throw it in distributed containers and placed together those of glass and paper, throughout the city (and that it can be thrown with the bottle included :).
<br>- Good morning north-health. I allow myself the freedom to try to get in touch with you, in the only way I have available, to, in case of no signs of life, "adopt" your proposal..
<br>- I agree with you, in the center, for example, the clean itinerant points work only 2 hours and each day are in one place, so it's difficult to bring something to the clean points, especially if you don't have your own vehicle, which seems to be a vague because you do not want to go with the trash on the bus to take it to throw it. in the market of mustets there is a container for recycling oil, h&m collects fabrics for recycling (not only clothing in good condition to donate it, but also that this route and very deteriorated), in the briccor of the English court there are containers for small appliances and lamps... maybe what you could ask the city council to collect information about the location all these "micro clean points" public and private on the city website, ordered by districts or located on a map to be easier to recycle.
<br>- the proposal is interesting but I fear that we are forgetting issues that are priorities for the lives of many families without resources that cannot feed their children. I remind you that Spain is the country of the ocde where inequality has advanced the most during the crisis. Inequality in Spain is advancing at a rate that exceeds 14 times to Greece. poverty and exclusion in Spain have increased alarmingly in recent years, with 13.4 million people at risk of exclusion in 2014 (29.2% of the Spanish population) as the report "an economy serving 1%" made public in 2016 by Oxfam intermon. On the other hand, we are waiting for us to apply 10 billion euros in cuts from Europe. we can continue to obviate this issue, think that nothing happens but now is the time to put in place actions against poverty:
<br>- they are also collected in some schools and even in some communities of neighbors. and the mobile clean points have a super varied schedule: in the morning a few days, in the afternoon others... and that only those of a district. but if you go next door (which also doesn't stay myu far), you have even more scope of schedule.
<br>- I think it is very necessary just like the container recycling glass, bricks, etc. I no longer know what to do with so much pot with used oil because I refuse to throw it down the drain.
<br>- it would be interesting to install containers in municipal markets and large areas.
<br>- Oh, my God.
<br>- I think it's fine, but under a restriction, how do you identify who pours and what oil pours? What would happen if some "citizen" pours vehicle oil, if everything goes together, it couldn't be differentiated.
<br>- I think it's a very good idea about supermarkets, they're places where people often come to and often close to homes.
<br>- That's a good idea, too.
<br>- totally agree, I have the nearest fixed clean spot fifteen minutes from home walking and on the coast, and in my neighborhood there are people who have it much further away. and I am young but there are many older people that would cost you a lot and couldn't. and the moving points are very variable and time-limited.
<br>I don't have any news in madrid of any, and less in moratal.
<br>- the oil is a product of great use and if we leave it for once a year or two we would accumulate much. also seems to me very good the idea of a special periodic collection as it comes with the furniture.
<br>- He's very good, too.
<br>- at the clean points of madrid there are containers for this oil.
<br>- I only know of one in my neighborhood, but they picked it up with bottles from the city hall, which lent to the children throughout the course. at the ceip joaquin costa.
<br>- I would like to invite you to notify all your supporters by notification that they visit the proposal that proposals over 100 can not be deleted each year with more than 100 support. (40 support) avoid that something like this (a period of arbitrary proposals), happen again or happen to the next proposals that are in the early picota.gracias.

<br>- I agree with this proposal, I live on the valley bridge and I don't have anywhere near where to throw it. In the end I throw it in a glass container and I end up throwing it in the trash, but it doesn't seem appropriate.<br>

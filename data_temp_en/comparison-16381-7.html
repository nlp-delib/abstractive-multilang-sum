 there are so many differences between a big city and a town that you don't understand what you want to refer to, and your threat... it seems that you're not one of those who recycle, maybe you bring a cardboard box to the container, but it's one of them that leaves them out because it doesn't fit through the hole . 
<br>  the town hall treats us, we are taken away from it. regarding the people I think it is obvious that neither the population, the one that generates waste, nor the aesthetics of the city have anything
<br> 15 years ago we had to walk a lot to find a cardboard recycling container, for example, . 
<br>  until the truck passes to pick it up they spend an average of 12 hours on the road, . 
<br>  until 8 a.m. the next day. another thing is that in their urbanization there is a garbage room . 
<br> hydraulic collection systems please?. I don't make up stories or it's the end of the world to walk a little bit, . 
<br>  don ́t defend the indefensible or deny the obvious, please. have you run out of arguments, indefensible and obvious... that will be your opinion, not the reality. you can update me on the type of collection . 
<br> the nineteenth century, is foolish, since the difference between small and large containers is an improvement towards energy efficiency, . 
<br>  the small containers of most neighborhoods pass on the street an average of 12 hours. regarding the pneumatic collection that it exposes to me good, inform yourself of the changes, the works and the cost with which it would lead to it in a city like madrid, .

I was superconscious about recycling for 20 years, but seeing as how the matter is becoming and how the town hall treats us, we are taken away from it. Neither the population, the one that generates waste, nor the aesthetics of the city have anything to do with it. urbanism forces us to have a garbage room, with which I very much agree for hygiene, aesthetics and smells.
<br>In front of my house they take out 4 of the oranges and 3 of the yellows daily, from 17:00 until 8 a.m. the next day. another thing is that in their urbanization there is a garbage room and now it bothers him to go out to throw it away. because 15 years ago we had to walk a lot to find a cardboard recycling container, for example, because the yellow ones did not exist.
<br>I don't make up stories or it's the end of the world to walk a little bit, but don't defend the indefensible or deny the obvious, please. my community of neighbors, which also exceeds fifty, is one more example, on the whole street the cubes remain out for many hours, as in many other streets of this city. I will put in your knowledge a data, waiting for it not to be frightened.
<br>Small and large containers is an improvement towards energy efficiency, and an improvement in acoustic pollution since it makes much less stops. do not worsen hygiene, health or aesthetics because the small containers of most neighborhoods pass on the street an average of 12 hours. regarding the pneumatic collection that it exposes seems to me good, inform yourself of the changes.

 I hello, should be applied to the whole district or neighborhood, greetings. . 
<br>  it is not the same as a city as a people, think it is obvious. yourself . 
<br>  neither the population, that generates waste, nor aesthetics of the city have anything to do with it. urbanism forces us to have a garbage room, . 
<br> example, don't has never been a problem 56 years ago . 
<br>  it is taken out about 2 hours before the truck passes to pick it up they spend an average of 12 hours on the road, . 
<br>  until 16 hours, do not see a difference so big with those that are fixed in the streets, . 
<br> neighbors, I will put in your knowledge a data, waiting for it not to be frightened, there are communities of neighbors who have no porter or janitor, it is going to be the end of the world by walking a little to throw the garbage. . 
<br>  don ́t defend the indefensible or deny the obvious, please. have you run out of arguments? indefensible . 
<br> I is the one who wants to take steps back instead of the future. you can't . 
<br>  if you want to present a proposal, you will be able to stop recycling if you remove your small containers from the door of your house. . 
<br>  it 's not characterized by being very clean, the truth. aesthetics thing goes for pleasures .

<br>in their urbanization there is a garbage room and now it bothers him to go out to throw it away
<br>there are many areas in our city that there have always been fixed community containers on the street
<br>my community of neighbors , which also exceeds 50, is one more example
<br>on the whole street the cubes remain out for many hours
<br>can you expand information on hydraulic collection systems
<br>has not given any weighty argument
<br>the difference between small and large containers is an improvement towards energy efficiency , and an improvement in acoustic pollution since it makes much less stops
<br>i repeat that the small containers of most neighborhoods pass on the street an average of 12 hours

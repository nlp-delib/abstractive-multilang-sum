- sport should be linked to health and it is logical that measures should be taken to promote it and a very good one would be to reduce rates and make bonuses that, as you say, do so even private tennis clubs.
<br>- a shame to see the empty tracks x the high price and next to people doing botelln in the park.
<br>- more abundant on this issue, if the tracks are already expensive by themselves, but still the light to play when it is dark (3,75 /hour). I find it intolerable that an hour of tennis costs more than 10,00, it is even more expensive than going to the cinema.It would also be interesting to improve the conditions for the reservation of facilities. although in many places you can already make telematic reservations, I think that, especially in some of the sportsmen, they are still insufficient. lastly, I hope that this proposal does not serve to make discounts in the price of the hourly zones of minimum occupancy and to take advantage of those discounts to justify an increase of the rates in the hours of maximum occupancy..
<br>- I support the motion.
<br>- the reduction is necessary, all of us who practice this sport know that at least we need two hours of rent for each game so the cost is doubled, and you need light at the end the game around 20. too much money!!.
<br>- the goal has to be to encourage sport.Modifying the fees of the facilities is a good way to do it and bring it closer to all people.In that line I would like to make a contribution in case you like to incorporate it: when on a track plays a minor and an adult (let's put a 7-year-old and his father) the fee that applies is that of the adult. However, it is clear that what the father is doing is to encourage his child to play.In these cases I think the fee should be the child, because the goal is to play the child and, of course, children (except the "prodigy") of short age need an adult to direct and encourage them.
<br>- some examples of cheaper rates in private management center (calculated in 2 hours of rent, which is what usually lasts the games):- town of the racket (in the morning and with bonus 2x1): 5.80 euros- cedars (inthe morning): 8 euros- magic box (Monday morning): 9 euros- municipal tracks (at any time/day): 13.80 this does not seem very reasonable. it is necessary to reduce the general price of municipal tracks and, especially, in the shorter hours of demand (morning in the week) so that they do not remain empty and the activity moves to the private tracks.
<br>- Obviously it is an excessive price. I agree in everything with the previous comments. On the other hand I want to contribute the bad conditions in which there are many of the tracks. I do not know if you can attach photos. the nets hold with shoelaces that the players we are putting on, the paints of the surfaces and of the totally worn lines, patches of considerable size that make the boots vote badly almost always, fences open from below that allows the balls to leave the track, etc. in general a disaster that with a minimal investment could be fixed..
<br>- hi, thanks to the creators of this proposal.I don't know if this is the mechanism for doing something about it, because it is difficult to get out mostly, but it is worth mentioning and supporting it.In addition to the price, I think that sportsmen have more problems with tennis than I would like to comment here: the quality of the tracks is very low.Cracked and unchecked tracks, nets without tape, broken chairs. lately they are remaking tracks, but at a low pace.During the summer the discounts of subscription *disappear*, I have no idea why. it turns out to be good for the pool and no longer for the tennis! it doesn't understand. and as you get off, you will again pay registration in autumn.
<br>- (...continuation) training ban on the tracks. in many multisports have been taken measures not to train on the slopes. any sport, as often as it is practiced, is trained more than played.Does municipal tennis courts belong only to very occasional players?enlarge reservations over the internet, and give the possibility to change at a distance in case of rain.<br>

- if I am not mistaken, being vegan/vegetarian is a choice. being lactose intolerant, gluten, or some kind of food is something that cannot be demanded or modified on my own. Religious motives... I do not share them, but respect them, although in the case of children the problem is more serious, because almost always the children are imposed on the religion of the parents, with everything that this entails, positive or negative. And so it is. eating kosher, not eating pork, or doing holy week does not invalidate the options that these exclude. I put veganism / vegetarianism here. I can be vegan for reasons of __________________________, but I must not deprive my children of what they want to eat if they find that it satisfies them and does not harm them. My criteria do not have to be their own, even if I like it. if homosexual omnivores come out, being hetero vegan, will not try to impose my vegan criterion. is an example. I hope that they will go into it.
<br>- the option of preparing a vegetarian or vegan meal, since it is a choice, I do not think it should exist as an option in the school dining rooms. it is not a question of illness or medical limitation, in that we agree. and that is why, unlike gluten-free or salt-free food (e.g.) is not available. everyone is free to choose a way of life, but must not pretend that others assume it. is an election, which I respect even though I don't share, that parents must carry out at home or where they consider. let's leave schools out of fashion.
<br>- a vegan or vegetarian person cannot eat meals that are served "normally" but a person who is neither vegan nor vegetarian should not care about eating a vegetarian or vegan meal...... at "normal" restaurants it is very difficult to eat a day menu without meat or fish. There should always be a first and a second that were vegan or vegan..... ideal for those who cannot eat certain animals on religious issues......... one of my proposals in case you want to vote.
<br>- vegetarianism is a question of customers. in the united kingdom the macdonals have vegetable burgers (very good by the way) because they have many vegetarian customers who wouldn't eat if they didn't have them.
<br>- I totally agree with you, the intrinsic idea exposed is brilliant, the possible options in the development of the theme are infinite, the clarity of the argument is capital, I have rarely had the opportunity to read such a pleasant theme, with the right length, with appropriate metric, without flowers.
<br>- a proposal to be followed:
<br>- hi sasha, I am concerned that you have not understood the proposal because you may not have correctly explained it. I am not creating a comparative aggravation among children who have health problems and vegetarians. I'm asking you not to compare it because you say well the vegetarian/vegetarian being is such a respectable choice as to choose to educate your children under some kind of religion that prevents them from eating certain foods. with religious reasons yes I compare them.It draws attention, on the other hand that you use the word "private" when you refer to an alternative proposal, optional,... I do not impose anything on my family but the system that is scripted by the meat and milk industry does impose on us what is "normal" on our table and what else is nonsense that generates expense and complications. I will answer to be vo at the root of this. don't take it wrong. are different points of view and point. a kiss, sasha..
<br>- is that a child does not know whether he wants to be vegan or not. as far as I am concerned they can offer it, but it is a more offer for parents than for children. because parents have already chosen to be Vegan, but a child still does not have the ability to discern... if he had all, all the information, he could choose. but at 7, 8 or 10 years, hardly. he may be headed for vegan/vegetarian routes and end up reneging soon... and vice versa. certainly I have already gone to vegetarian restaurants and come back when I need. and I also agree on the reasons for being vegan or vegetarian because they are polluting milk, meat and tissues with dangerous substances. so I try to choose good meat even if it costs me more..
<br>- hi Sergio, I don't know if with intent or not, Sergio, but it offends me personally that you speak of "modes" when there are thousands of families (fathers, mothers, children, grandparents...) vegetarians/currant vegans, early-ageers who, by the way, have neither time for fashions. the vegan snob, sergio, no longer wears itself. it can be vegetarian for many reasons: dietetics, health, ethics/moralismas far as fashion is respectable. being vegan for the reason that it is never brings anything bad for fear that it brings disinformation. 90% of vegans/vegetarians are for reasons of awareness against animal abuse and we refuse to collaborate with the exploitation of the meat industries. we are not a few. we ask for this change. this alternative to be more consistent with the education of our children. we're not getting into the dish of anyone. we enter panic and confused alternative with imposition.
<br>- you say each one is free to choose a way of life, but must not pretend that others assume it. Do the others not want to assume what? that each one in choosing his way of living in which no animals are exploited or killed can have that alternative for the education of his children? assume what? that my son on the day he touches meat instead of chicken steak put mushrooms that for certain many cheaper? or in his defect that he does not put it? assumes what? if we are going through the hoop to be able to be normal and that my child is normal before a clear imposition normalized and extended by the meat and milk industry. sergio, the same. do not take it wrong. at best we have not understood but for that we are here. a cordial greeting.
<br>- Thank you shurmadrileño. They ask for a lot of support, too. bffff.
<br>- there's sasha, you've said it a little child may epa us if he wants to be vegan or not (somehow it will be yes) but why the system, which I consider uninformed and handled with meat and milk companies has to decide to blow up what our children have to eat. I want the best for my family and we don't lack or medical checks to check that everything is in order. you can't avoid or control what your children want to have. imagine that crazy a little one on birthday or in the same yard that they share everything..I personally don ́t get obsessed with it. let it flow. but this alternative helps them to assume more coherently the education that their parents want for them. kisses.
<br>- the choice of a meal with meat or fish is also an election.
<br>- sahsa but for the same reason a child does not know if he wants to eat meat or fish or not... let there be more options to choose from....
<br>- a child is always offered to eat meat, fish, vegetables, ovolacteos... it is according to his tastes that he chooses one thing or another. his tastes. what he wants. what it takes to his mouth and he likes. meat, Fish, vegetables and ores. without exclusion. the child does not know, he does not understand, he doesn't understand if there is anything else to choose one way or another: to be omnivorous or to discard freely and consciously a food. that is what happens. likewise, as I am reading from the one he proposes, it seems to me that the thing is more than that there is a choice of natural food 100%, ecological, sustainable, without additives. in which case, it is not a request, but a requirement!! to which, also it will be asked if the child is equally decanted by the meat, will the parents then force the children to eat certain foods? this links with what I want to arrive at: not to condition the will of the children. they do not choose them.
<br>- copy: "As I am reading from the part of what he proposes, it seems to me that the thing is going to be more that there is an option of natural food 100%, ecological, sustainable, without additives. in which case, it is not a request, but a demand!!" I don't know what you have read that has led you to this conclusion. I am willing to debate but as long as it doesn't distort or put words that I haven't written. a cordial greeting.
<br>- sthercita, you have all my support, my children are vegan and have vegan menus at school but I have been lucky, in other schools do not give you the option.The reasons are ethical and they do not want to eat animal suffering, it is not a diet or a fashion, is to live without using animals in any way.
<br>- Thank you, karimakrf. Let's see if the proposal takes strength. It takes a lot of support. And yes, the truth is that you've had a great deal of luck with the school. hug.
<br>- I fully support your proposal. We are increasingly the people we have chosen to feed ourselves consciously, and in other cities of the ue already exists this option, I hope it will also be taken into account here in madrid..
<br>- Go ahead with it!
<br>- Of course I do! My son is in a public school and he can't opt for the dining room because we are vegetarians. I cannot work because I have to look for him to eat at home and take him back to school. And as neither do they allow him to carry his food we are tied up with hands!.
<br>We're going to move this proposal all over the corners to see if we can get them to take it into account.
<br>- Let's move the proposal among everyone, please, that needs a lot of support. Thank you very much.
<br>- We're going to move the proposal among all of you, please, that needs a lot of support. Thank you very much.
<br>- I think that with so many economic problems, and there are so many children who need school meals to feed themselves, that we should be happy that our children have food. Children must know what it is to eat meat, eggs and milk because the culture in which they live also eat them, then, with the example of example at home, adequate information and adulthood, that they choose what they think best. isolating children is not a good solution when they start their socialization. at house, what we want..
<br>- you didn't understand the proposal. I'm sorry. I recommend you read the opinions of the other participants and my answers.
<br>- hi sasha, from my experience I can tell you that my 9-year-olds are very clear that they don't want to eat animals... they're more clear than I am. of babies feeding them on a vegetarian diet and they couldn't choose but naughty 9 years of their life they continue to opt freely and without imposition a vegan diet..
<br>- I'm not vegan because milk and meat is contaminated. Also vegetables and fries are so I buy ecological. it's something much more serious and global. it is ethical slgo. that when my girl is an age I will explain to her in my house we don't buy meat because we collaborate with the environment. if tomorrow she wants to eat a hamburger out of the house no one will say anything. I invite you to see the documentary cowspiracy and you will understand that the livestock industries are the ones that are destroying the ecosystem most. a greeting<br>

I find it intolerable that an hour of tennis costs more than 10,00, it is even more expensive than going to the cinema. The goal has to be to encourage sport. Modifying the fees of the facilities is a good way to do it and bring it closer to all people.
<br>Town of the racket (in the morning and with bonus 2x1): 5.80 euroscedars (inthe morning): 8 eurosmagic box (Monday morning): 9 eurosm municipal tracks (at any time/day): 13.80 this does not seem very reasonable. It is necessary to reduce the general price of municipal tracks.

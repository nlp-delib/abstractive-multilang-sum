 traffic. Let's fight against the brutal noise of traffic, let's all fight against traffic. but fighting against music and art seems very wrong to me. it can be played on a regular schedule, at the forbidden night prohibited. the percussion is not noise, it's music. the noise is it of traffic. so selfish posture ruining a person the enjoyment of an entire park, not to mention the noise

 there are people we think about differently.Do you know what noise pollution is?Do like that they touch percussion near you when you need to rest?Silence is the scarcest good that exists today.We must protect it. if the city council had set you up a park 15 meters from your bedroom . 
<br>  the percussion is not noise, it's music. the noise is produced by traffic, let's all fight against the brutal noise of traffic. but fighting against music and art seems very wrong to me. it can be played on a regular schedule, at the forbidden night. solution:
<br> a park is a place where many want to listen to music I go to a suitable place.If we play music on the street we can disturb many travellers and neighbors who at that time do not want to have a reading.I totally agree that traffic is the biggest cause of noise in the city, but it is not the only one, in fact many pedestrian areas are among the loudest. sometimes the sound of music is so high that it nullifies all the other sounds that may be in a park; other times, when luckily the park is
<br> the park of retreat, is wide enough for there to be a place for everybody. donandor will have to adapt to most, and most sleep at night. donator . 
<br>  there are also many small parks where making music would imply forcing everyone to listen to it, whether we want it or not, not fair either. it wouldn't be at all hours or anywhere. it would be on a regulated schedule .

Percussion is not noise, it's music. the noise is it of traffic. so selfish is to want to use only the park to hear the birds or the silence. in a park there is space for everyone. who wants music, gets close to musicians, who wants birds comes close to birds...the parks must be a place for all.
<br>When I want to listen to music I go to a suitable place. if you read my comment carefully you will see that I have not used the word "noise".I believe that a park is a place where many want to enjoy the sounds of nature and also, if possible, some silence.
<br>I don't run away from music, I assure you that I love it, but I do not want to hear it every hour and anywhere. Most people think you're making noise. We'll have to adapt and accept it. Then they'll put a full-volume percussion battery under your window. You'll see what I like.

depends on the time . those of us who sleep in front of the park the games of some are annoying of others
<br>if the city council had set you up a park 15 meters from your bedroom like me , you had already tell me the energy you get up the next day
<br>if you read my comment carefully you will see that i have not used the word "noise-.i believe that a park is a place where many want to enjoy the sounds of nature
<br>there are people who work at night and have to rest during the day or simply want to have a reading
<br>when luckily the park is very large , it is necessary to get away many hundreds of meters from the focus of the music to stop hearing it
<br>in madrid there are some very large parks where making music would imply forcing everyone to listen to it
<br>i have seen that you have changed your original proposal and now you limit it to withdrawal , although i still do not like the idea

- it would be better if they were all eliminated than we seem to be living in a village.
<br>- I don't know what you have against the villages... what we should do is stop generating so much garbage, and learn to recycle better.
<br>- hello, according to the proposal, even more, should be applied to the whole district or neighborhood, greetings.
<br>I assure you that if the measure is carried out, it stopped recycling, and I have nothing against the people, but it is not the same as a city as a madrid as a people, I think it is obvious.
<br>- Explain yourself because there are so many differences between a big city and a town that you don't understand what you want to refer to, and your threat... it seems that you're not one of those who recycle, maybe you bring a cardboard box to the container, but it's one of them that leaves them out because it doesn't fit through the hole and you do not want to disassemble it...
<br>- you have no idea how I am and what I recycle all my life. I was superconscious about recycling for 20 years, but seeing as how the matter is becoming and how the town hall treats us, we are taken away from it. regarding the people I think it is obvious that neither the population, the one that generates waste, nor the aesthetics of the city have anything to do with it. urbanism forces us to have a garbage room, with which I very much agree for hygiene, aesthetics and smells, and now wants to put common cubes on the street, focus of plagues, dirt and smells... then I retire.
<br>- because 15 years ago we had to walk a lot to find a cardboard recycling container, for example, because the yellow ones did not exist... regarding the garbage room, it will be mandatory in the houses built in the last 10/15 years, because in most we have a room to keep the cubes and we do not allow to throw the garbage until they are on the street, and since they are taken out until the truck passes to pick it up they spend an average of 12 hours on the road, and until 16 hours, I do not see a difference so big with those that are fixed in the streets, especially in hygiene, besides they are larger and one of each type per portal is not needed, in front of my house they take out 4 of the oranges and 3 of the yellows daily, from 17:00 until 8 a.m. the next day. another thing is that in their urbanization there is a garbage room and now it bothers him to go out to throw it away..
<br>- if with the aesthetics of a town compared to a city it means that in the village it doesn't matter that it is full of shit next to the containers I don't agree at all. there are many areas in our city that there have always been fixed community containers on the street, like in the elipa or in san blas and they are not the focus of plagues, neither dirt, nor odors, as long as they are well cared for, and that people are respectful, that after all we are the ones who throw the trash, not the city..
<br>- because instead of moving forward in those neighborhoods with hydraulic collection systems, I think it's called the one that through pipes goes straight to collectors, or more modern ones, we take steps back. It's anti-aesthetic, besides much less hygienic.
<br>- in my previous building, which had a garbage or container room whatever you want to call it, which has never been a problem 56 years old, it is taken out about 2 hours before the truck passed and of course the garbage goes down when you can if you haven't taken it out in time for the doorman to pick it up. in the new one we have a janitor and don't take it out through the doors, we drop it when it's good for us, it would be more..., and takes it out when the truck goes through. maybe I had to review the policy in his building together with the rest of the neighbors to find better accommodation.
<br>- my community of neighbors, which also exceeds fifty, is one more example, on the whole street the cubes remain out for many hours, as in many other streets of this city, do not tell me that you have never seen any like it.... and if the truck passes, by ejmeplo, at 6 o'clock in the morning I doubt much that it will be taken out two hours before. I will put in your knowledge a data, waiting for it not to be frightened, there are communities of neighbors who have no porter or janitor, it is more there are people in this world that we have always taken the garbage for ourselves, they have never picked it up, and less directly from our door. It must be therefore that we do not put so many problems, we can approach the containers without suffering, and we do no invent stories of bad smells nor believe that it is going to be the end of the world by walking a little to throw the garbage.
<br>- can you expand information on hydraulic collection systems please?.
<br>- I don't make up stories or it's the end of the world to walk a little bit, but don ́t defend the indefensible or deny the obvious, please.
<br>- have you run out of arguments? indefensible and obvious... that will be your opinion, not the reality. you can update me on the type of collection you speak of in another comment you made: "for instead of going forward in those neighborhoods with hydraulic collection systems, I think it is called so that through tubes goes straight to collectors" how and where does it work?.
<br>- no, I haven't run out of arguments, but I think that with the data are more than enough and what I don't want is to waste much time with someone who according to their reality we must live in the nineteenth century p.e. worsening the hygiene, health and aesthetics of a city. as far as the collection system is concerned, I hope this is worth it: hydraulic and it was pneumatic, forgiveness.
<br>- Oh, my God.
<br>- is pneumatic and not hydraulic, regretted the mistake.
<br>- has not given any weighty argument, just repeats the nineteenth century, which is foolish, since the difference between small and large containers is an improvement towards energy efficiency, and an improvement in acoustic pollution since it makes much less stops. do not worsen hygiene, health or aesthetics because I repeat that the small containers of most neighborhoods pass on the street an average of 12 hours. regarding the pneumatic collection that it exposes seems to me good, inform yourself of the changes, the works and the cost with which it would lead to it in a city like madrid, and if you want to present a proposal, you will be able to stop wasting time talking about past times, and stop threatening to stop recycling if you remove your precious small containers from the door of your house.
<br>- the dumbest is the one who wants to take steps back instead of the future. you can't talk to someone so closed, you yourself portray yourself denying the maximum, that you have said and repeated hundreds of associations and collectives, and logically anyone sees that a cube that cleans the community of neighbors is cleaner and far away from rats and cockroaches that being permanently on the street and with cleaning in charge of the city council, that it is not characterized by being very clean, the truth. the aesthetics thing I understand that goes for pleasures and so it transmits to you should like to have the garbage at the door of your house, and to know how it has it inside. I am oly passing from preaching in the desert. if you like it so much, go to a village and be able to be abandoned so that you live in all its intensity the delay that you like so much and stop disqualifying and say assholes.
<br>- I am talking calmly, it is you who does not stop repeating that you will not waste time responding, and now you have started to insult directly. my house is very clean, thank you. I repeat that today the only difference between fixed containers and those of community is energy saving and less noise pollution, and it allows to throw the garbage at the time that each one wants, as you like to do, that are steps forward. It speaks of the dirt they accumulate, can complain to the ayto, I have not yet seen rats or cockroaches. it assures you that the Ayto is not very clean... that is the thing of the citizens, who are the ones who throw the trash. progress is not based on their comfort, is an improvement for the whole world, have or not a quarter of garbage, and the delay is not wanting to see the generality and close in their own case, it still does not want to see that more than half of the communities have their individual cube on the street from 6 to 12h on average, it passes a little by madrid and it will find out.<br>

 women carry burka in their breasts, not men. to compare the sadistic . 
<br>  women with a woman who carries a burka in a more developed country in feminism (although it is very much to be done) seems to me exaggerated. . 
<br>  the use of the burka is forbidden, I would like you to know that the majority of women who wear it is by their own will, .

I don't know if you should ban, but of course you have to take steps to minimize all the negative facets that this type of dress carries. I think it is not a case of economic punishment or punishment, but it is only a project in which women with such a garment are denied entry, not everything is arranged with the desire to collect.

 women with burka in breasts, not men. to compare the sadistic and shameful drama of women in certain countries with a woman who carries a burka in a more developed country in feminism (although it is very much to be done) seems to me exaggerated. if it is forbidden to whom should punish the law, because they are able to, on top of it, impose a fine on the poor woman who wears burka, .

since there are human rights and the right to religion i do not like and support the proposal either
<br>i think it is not a case of economic punishment or punishment , but it is only a project in which women with such a garment are denied entry
<br>although i agree that the use of the burka is forbidden , i would like you to know that the majority of women who wear it is by their own will

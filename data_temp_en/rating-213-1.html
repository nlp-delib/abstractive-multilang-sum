- that it is difficult to support a proposal to generate employment that has no cost and allows to help people?.
<br>- in order to be able to create public jobs we have to recover the management that has been privatized in many services, please support my proposal! thank you very much
<br>- it's clear.
<br>- I totally agree to create a municipal job market. Some over 50 years old are living in a very precarious situation, with no hope of finding a job. Thank you for your answer.
<br>- Thank you.
<br>- to see, there are bags derived from the oppositions for the maintenance of parks and gardens that should have priority and in which there are a lot of people stopped long-term and with very harsh situations.I am in favour of the posts being covered by personnel derived from oppositions, and only when they are exhausted will they go to unemployment.
<br>- nothing to add alone
<br>- I liked your proposal for a spirit of solidarity... I suggest you take a look at this one that you will certainly support...
<br>- I offer you another way to generate employment and help families without resources. Considering that in Madrid, independent food banks that operate have only 4 employees and 450 volunteers, the creation of a municipally run and public food bank would generate an environment number of 500 jobs for the coordination of the collection, storage and delivery of food to families with no resources.
<br>- municipal cleaning and gardening services should be recovered<br>

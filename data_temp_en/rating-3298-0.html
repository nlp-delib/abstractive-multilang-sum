- Hello good afternoon, just, I don't go to bulls, but those who don ́t agree with the same, who do not go, respect those who like.
<br>- that I would eliminate death in the bull's square and flag all over and sting, and that he would be bullied as much as he wanted and then put himself in the corral again.
<br>- put the flags with velcro.
<br>- Only savages enjoy with savages!
<br>- where is the respect that is due to every living being? the hobby of bulls is not trivial, it is embarrassing and alarming to see a "human being" enjoying with blood and suffering (even if it is an animal)..
<br>- I don't agree.
<br>- Come on, what's wrong with you is not torture, you're wrong with death. What's easy is to play with other people's suffering.
<br>- I'm not up to bullfights and of course I won't. I respect everything that I don't like as long as no damage is done. I just can't agree to hire snipers and I just don ́t want to hire them myself.
<br>- lola, I don't think you've read well, I think I'm going to remove everything that's blood in the sand and only tore the bull, but it seems that there are certain people influenced by Catalans who want to end everything that represents Spanish or Spanish and what they claim is to remove bull squares and bullfighters and whole Spain, I would leave the bulls but without any kind of suffering for the animal, but there are people who reason is not in their head and think either, please before writing well what others have written and I think that I have made it clear that I don ́t want to flag the bull, nor steal it, nor kill it that is where the bull suffers, if you give it a cap and send the boy to the bull nothing happens, but everyone understands what they want when they read and draw wrong conclusions from the bull.
<br>- but you eat meat, and chickens and turkeys, and calves and other animals, right? because one option is to be vegan and if not, you are contributing to the sacrifice of animals, suffering and becoming saved with them, see only the chickens to see how they treat them, or how they kill the pig, or the lamb or the goat or goat, the one who does not see it as the bull does not mean that it is not done, it is done, too, since now no one eats meat of any kind because it has been decided by the fact that the animal cannot be killed and less suffer, please.I tell you that I understand the bull because it is a spectacle, but nothing more, they have all the right to torture what they want, but if I agree on the suffering of the bull for the show must not exist, but not that it takes the bulls away, not that they want it all to suffer.
<br>- You don't need to signal a lack that I don ́t have. tmapoco you need to shout. when I say suffering, understand it as suffering and not as blood. suffering is a tremendously wide word. I advise you to review the dictionary.
<br>- I know it's suffering, unfortunately for me, maybe you don't know it yet, and maybe you better not know it,
<br>- eye... let's not confuse terms. I'm a vegetarian but even if I wasn't, it has nothing to do with killing to eat (and I say killing, that I didn't have to torture) than killing or not killing and just torturing for fun or because I am having a good time, that there's a lot of pain between animals because of our hand, even to eat? of course, and it's something that needs to be eradicated.
<br>- Believe me, I'm very sorry that you know what it is. I too, and I also know what can torture your life, unfortunately... that's why I can't stand the suffering or the smallest being in the animal world. they suffer, but we don't want to see it. mine isn't a poseureo or it's because it is now fashionable. is because I cannot bear it and because I really know that animals suffer. and I think this last part is where we disagree.
<br>- I propose to change the bulls for people who are in favor of the bullfighting. If so in favor you are, volunteer to be nailed swords. So you will continue to have your macabre spectacle that you so much like.
<br>- no one has stopped protecting or respecting the bullfighting, we just don't want to pay for it among all..
<br>- parties...:facepalm.pd. I celebrate the one your mother stuck when she was pregnant with you.
<br>- the one who enjoys torturing an animal is a sick person and has to be tied up.
<br>- it will be your "culture", that of unlearned savages. don't put civilized people into this. your culture of blood, not ours!.
<br>- you can not put before the fun and depravity of a few and the business of 4 entrepreneurs to the pain and suffering of living beings, the inquisition and the Roman circuses that threw people to the lions were also tradition for a long time and not for that reason must be preserved. who does not want to appreciate that the animal suffers and prefers to put his pocket and enjoy that it is not cynical and recognizes the reality and does not deny it saying that it does not suffer or that is tradition..... against the ill-treatment tolerance zero!!!!<br>

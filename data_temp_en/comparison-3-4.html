 3.165,000 trees be planted. And if new trees are planted, or if it is appreciated that some are not treated as they correspond, to solve it. I'm not against the trees. Everything you tell me I share, but one for Madrid is childish. Planting trees seems fine to me, but I would have to see the care given to them... that has already died more than one for the fall of
<br> a new style of gardening.. as more wild... Madrid how much with many trees and lots, very much green surface.. just as there is, I don't know it, but so I see at least in my neighborhood the feeling is quite lax... an integral plan with a detailed record that there is planted, that it is to be replaced, infrastructure, expenditure, etc. I support the proposal. another proposal
<br> replanting with trees areas adjacent to madrid. in vicalvaro there is a decorative source in which recently ducks fly and swim in it. I would like them to plant more trees where I have never seen more variety than sparrows, which by the way suffer the rigors of summer as none. so more trees in the peeled areas of the parks, for the sake of everyone

can... : pages where you can plant trees, for 10... imagine a city council, .
<br>trees can be planted and are convenient, but not one for each .
<br>that has already been done and stopped doing as inoperative. .
<br>if : if we plant more trees, the chances of one falling on our head increase... eye... is a too ambitious objective, .the leads to what someone was saying, an integral plan with a detailed record that there is planted, .
<br>the dirty, dry gardens, full of dog shit, dead spaces or with four cards, eye .
<br>the people who visit me from other cities have this same impression, at least so they manifest it to me. .
<br>to propose to plant one tree per citizen, does not take away that the public parks are maintained and cared for, .if the streets are narrow and do not fit in the sidewalks, then you can enable the parking area of the road, for example, you plant a tree between half of every 3-4 cars parked so that from corner to corner
<br>in madrid .
<br>there : there is a private, private and non-profit initiative .
<br>there are streets where its non-existence produces a huge sensation of aridity. .<br>

It's a way for everyone to become aware. Of course you can... there are pages where you can plant trees, for 10... imagine a city council, it would be much cheaper. And where would 3.165,000 trees be planted? That has already been done and stopped doing as inoperative.
<br>Madrid is a fairly populated city of trees. It is rare to see a street without them. The important thing is to give good care to those we have. Maybe it would be necessary to repopulate large areas such as brown and surrounding madrid. It may be more practical to put it in value.
<br>Madrid gardening service is low and every year it happens is worse, without resources and without staff. There are streets in madrid where they have done so. It could be generalized. who does not like that in your street there are trees, birds and such joy!:-).

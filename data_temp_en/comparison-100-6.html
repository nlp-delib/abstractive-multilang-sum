I have created one specifically for graffiti throughout the city, please support it. reduce the number of decibels allowed so that dogs can be free and pee-pee. I'm voting for my proposal for the washroom cleaning. It's a global problem about unchecked paints. Please vote.
<br>I support cleaning, but I like graffiti, I don't see anything unhygienic about it. Neighbors by a meter in the area of the streets the yebens, shrimp and valmojado. more than fines that they won't be able to pay would make them perform community cleaning services.
<br>I would pay 10 per month for that pet that I care for and gives me affection without doubt. You have to take care of all neighborhoods equally, as well as vallecas is being taken by drug addicts and camels. Please support my proposal! and spread to the rest of the neighborhoods.
<br>The cleaning contracts were armored in the previous legislature, and, even if they want to terminate such contracts due to clear non-compliance, it cannot be. In order to prevent something like this from happening again (government who governs), I encourage you to support the following proposal: contracts without possibility of shielding and not beyond the legislature.

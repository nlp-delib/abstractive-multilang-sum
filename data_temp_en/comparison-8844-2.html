 tourists are richer because of the mere fact of traveling. of course there are budgets for all tastes.. it seems to me . 
<br>  the promoter exposes. it is a solidarity rate. if we have money to see a city and enjoy its services, that by the way, they pay their neighbors. sure it is not very burdensome, pay one, per night . 
<br> the services I understand it and it is certainly unfair for the registered persons to pay through taxes a service that is subsequently taken advantage of by other people; . 
<br>  the collected is destined to the coffers of the city council for that we already have managers who have and must work to not leave them empty. in any case seems to me a great initiatory yours .

the arrival of tourists to the city already results in a source of income for the city council through taxes to all the activities it carries out
<br>so i do not see the justification that they pay another tax more.as well , neither has more goods, nor presents any distinguishing characteristic that motivates them to pay taxes that other collectives do not pay
<br>the inhabitants of madrid also do tourism and for each other
<br>it comes to be compensated).2. to charge visitors a price different from that of those registered by the municipal public services
<br>those tourists who do not use these services are not forced to pay for them

<br> I will not vote for your proposal.I understand that the 'priority' of drivers is to park their vehicle. with the enormous difficulty existing in our city . 
<br>  an example, the pedestrian is the 'lower' part on the sidewalks, in which bicycles have priority.It is only an example.I share with you our need (peathons) to walk along the unhindered sidewalks .

I think that the roads must be at least 3 meters wide so that the motorcycles can park, and we should support that there are more motorcycles than cars. The optimal solution that pleases drivers and pedestrians is that they have the necessary parking for them. That if tb. should pay like cars to park, or do they not pollute?
<br>I understand that the 'priority' of drivers is to park their vehicle. The regulations governing the parking of motorcycles on the sidewalk, clearly specifies how they should be on the public road. The problem is that many drivers do not comply with this law. This rule should not be amended, enforced, with penalties if necessary. I will not vote for your proposal.

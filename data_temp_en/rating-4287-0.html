- many car users do not respect traffic lights or speed limits and park in pedestrian and sidewalk steps, endangering pedestrians and cyclists and causing accidents. cars, even if they have motor and registration, are four-wheeled vehicles and are bound by the same traffic rules as motorcycles or bicycles. Mobility agents and municipal police should ensure to avoid the incivic behaviour of some car drivers..
<br>- Oh, my God.
<br>- the agents of mobility and the municipal police, I don't know why dark and strange reason look elsewhere always in relation to this topic. it is something manifest that I can demonstrate and it is happening every day of the week. I can record 365 days of the year to different cyclists committing various violations and to different municipalities seeing it and passing it through the lining of the... because the regulation I would like to boast and venture that they know it..
<br>- no more bikes running through the sidewalks.
<br>- bicycles, as they do not have a motor or occupy the same as a car or a motorcycle, perhaps they should have a different regulation than motor vehicles.On the other hand, sidewalks are not the place of their bikes except in case of car counts. for the debate, what is worse is a cyclist who jumps a traffic light when no one comes on the road that crosses or a pedestrian crosses a street in red when no-one comes and/or without pedestrians?
<br>- Look at him wherever you look at him, they both do it wrong.
<br>They do it wrong according to the rules of the day, which doesn't mean they're the best. If almost everyone, and in proportion I think more pedestrians than cyclists, fail to comply with such a rule, maybe it's not in accordance with people's reality.
<br>- a purpose of traffic rules, is to avoid accidents. which skip them can be due to several reasons, may lack traffic lights and when having to move away it crosses improperly, there vka solution is to put more traffic lights or step of zebra, or by incivism. what exactly do you suggest? what is the reality that has changed so that the norm does not adjust.
<br>- it doesn't fit? the case is that if no one comes both the cyclist and.
<br>- as the pedestrian may decide to pass, the problem is that if there is an accident the rule clarifies who did it wrong.
<br>- I want to say that the only way to know who is responsible in the event of an accident is by applying the norm. bicycles must respect traffic rules because they are vehicles, vulnerable, but vehicles and more vulnerable are still pedestrians..
<br>- Nor should we generalize neighbours. Many other car drivers also do not respect the rules of traffic (non-signal laps, speed limits, etc.) and we have not created a police aimed at chasing them. when a cyclist fails to comply with a normal traffic code, an administrative penalty can be imposed on him as well as on a driver.
<br>- I have a question to all the drivers here, who are also pedestrians like all of them. you are standing on a quiet street of a lane, traffic light in green for cars, in red for pedestrians, you don't pass a soul look and you only see trees. you wait 3 minutes until the traffic light gets green? or look and if nobody comes you pass safely? the pedestrian is committing an infringement.
<br>- by the way totally according to the bikes can never go on the sidewalk.Despite that you play life with cars that of course do not respect the speed of the bike lane that is everywhere madrid at 30km/h. and I don't speak in this case of a few exceptions, I speak of 9 out of 10 cars that I have seen with my own eyes do not go to 30 km/h or 50km/hr, of course to more than 50 kills a cyclist as in the past.That is no excuse for cyclists to be a danger to pedestrians, pedestrians are the most vulnerable and the most to protect. bicycles never in the sidewalk, but please, the first thing we start to impose fines to offenders who go on more than 30km /h by bike lane, and to see if that way we lower the pollution and reduce the madrid beree that is disgusting.
<br>- bicycles run around where they want to go without respecting the rules of movement. they respect nothing or anyone. they have to run along the road and comply with the regulations of movement like everyone else. the municipal police must already act against these offenders.
<br>- I am a peaceful citizen, I don't have a car, I use public transport and I usually go walking or walking to the places, and what I find is a constant aggression, motorcycles parked anywhere interrupting the passage, bicycles assaulting pedestrians, groups along the sidewalk of the great road in those two-wheeled armatosts, a constant assault, it is as if the pedestrians had to ask permission to walk on the sidewalks. the worst is that the municipal police never intervene.
<br>- I think that bikes can share sidewalks with pedestrians always knowing that on the sidewalk the pedestrian is the one that has priority because it goes slower and so long as there is no bike lane, that unfortunately in madrid today happens in almost all its streets.On the other hand I do not see how many people are complaining here walking like crazy bikes on sidewalks, I use the bike on the pavement, with great care at very slow speed if there are other pedestrians and respectful with the priority they have, I insist if I had bike lanes I would go on the bike lane but there is and I do NOT want to risk my life, nor go out on the road. I believe that with good intention the two can live together.
<br>- I drive a bike, but also a car and a motorcycle.The traffic rules are not "more for one than for another".They are clear and include bicycles.They are vehicles, and they are forbidden to travel along the sidewalks.Is it so difficult to understand?.
<br>Mobility officers and the municipal police should ensure to avoid the incivic behaviors of all those who skip the rules.Anyone who can cause an accident, are not more preferable than others.
<br>- if they fail to comply with the rule, it is because they know they are not going to sanction them, not because "I don't agree with the reality of the people".Doesn't you have to make sure that pedestrians can go through the only place they have allowed: the sidewalk?If you dropped 200 euros for travelling on the sidewalk, you'll see how much you saved yourself from doing so.
<br>- I'm sick of bikes being put on, because madrid isn't prepared for it or his people.It's like a fashion, but there's no bike lane, and there are no cops to regulate it, and they go x over the sidewalks and without braking, and on top of which you're taking a quiet walk, you have to be the one to give in if you don't want an accident. me and my dog have already caught us several times in some corner and I've seen the elderly also that they've passed and the cyclists as if nothing. if people want to be healthy they're going with the bike but know how to go and where, and but if they go to the field before they put the bikes they should have created a regulation and fines so that this doesn't happen.<br>

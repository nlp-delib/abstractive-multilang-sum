- because the use of public transport is not encouraged outside peak hours? for example, in London, it was much cheaper to take out a simple ticket to use between 09.30 and 4.30 than for the rest of the day.
<br>- What you're commenting on in your proposal, is what has Londons with a card. Loads, you use it, you don't use it doesn't tell you..
<br>- perhaps, if the bus drivers were not so abrupt, and the subway didn't smell so bad, public transport would be used more.
<br>- they could also lower the price of the metro bonus and the transport bonus to the unemployed, not having these financial resources sufficient to be able to travel to carry out job interviews, sealed from the unemployment card... and in the case of having minors they might also have a special price in their transport bonus up to a certain age, for example up to the 16 years that they would pay half the cost of the fertilizers (6,10 in case of the subway bonus and 10,00 in case for the monthly bonus).
<br>- in general, the prices of all should be lowered. the age of the young fertilizer is increased but those who do not opt for it and we also work need to be more economical. not by working you can pay the prices so high that the transport costs. some do not earn 1500 euros per month.
<br>- I think very good ideas, but I also propose a cheaper metro bus for children and young people (for example 5) those who have two or more children we spend a pasta every time we use the metro or bus (cheap rooms the private car and the ticket of the hour) more info about my proposal in twitter @metrobusjovenya.
<br>- totally in accordance with the same as
<br>- totally agree. count on my vote. I gave you another that we just said hello!.
<br>- it is important to add that what has just been proposed today with regard to the unemployed is exclusively for those who are receiving a benefit from the so-called "extraordinary" which is only available 6 months after they have lost the right to the usual unemployment benefit. It is important this since the media call them "long-term unemployed", and it is not the right term. Do not fool us the president of the madrid community with that patch and include all the unemployed.
<br>- a card like the oyster of London is the fairest. that you discount what you carry traveling quadno exits, taking into account the most advantageous way to measure between distance/number of stops/time.Informatically you can apply all kinds of discounts (3rd age, unemployed, student, frequent traveler...) even for the bus you can connect to a mobile phone with nfc or sticker it.
<br>- making the ticket a temporary validity (e.g. 1 hour or 1:30) would starve the greater use of public transport, since when you have to take different means of transport the price is multiplied, limiting its public utility. in this way, the public transport use is advantageous even for travel to do something fast..
<br>- totally in accordance with the same as
<br>- applying the tic, with a personal prepaid or postpaid smart card per km travelled, would greatly optimize the use of public transport, besides making it much easier to use. a greeting
<br>- repeated the proposal! I feel that I am wasting time reading repeated proposals. I ask respect and responsibility: let's read and look first for our proposal in case it already exists! thank you!.
<br>- repeated!!!.
<br>- Great idea for the sticker on the phone.
<br>- Metrobus.. I pay for rent that if it's the fairest..
<br>- almost all the proposals that citizens comment on are already listed in the first part of your proposal are already included in one of the proposals described, but the second part (which only counts the days actually used), I think it is new and therefore the support and step to include both in the list of unrepealed proposals and in the compilation of proposals on transport.
<br>- a pity... because it is totally logical and not to do it apart from abusive, it still does not encourage the use of public transport. in palm of Mallorca has been working for years, a disappointment that in madrid does not come forward, taking into account the.greater distances..
<br>-...for not commenting on the prices. another that stuck us with "the prices of European means of transport". and for when also the salaries??? if we equate, we equate everything. do not fool us..<br>

I propose zones so that dogs can be free and pee-can, voted lola. It seems to me that canine basic education should be a service of the city council. I also think that it should include courses of responsible tenure, although this would be directed to another different sector.
<br>Cesar Millan responds to cj's proposal for a canine municipal school. He says the proposal is not a competition, but a way of improving the quality of life of guide and dog. Millan says that the proposal does not attempt to supplant the functions and the need for the work you do.
<br>A course of obedience and dog management seemed perfect, but in the proposal it says to learn about dog psychology, which is not turkey mucus. The most important thing is to start! and then naturally (as happens with everything) and over time grow in order to be able to offer solution and help to more needs.
<br>The title of the proposal is a simple label, you look at details that deviate you from the topic I want to propose: "municipal canine education courses", it is a generic title, the purpose is to serve to classify the proposal and be found in the searches. I apologize if you have felt offended, it is not even much less the intention when I write, you see that writing I am really rude. I accept your apologies.
<br>There's a very good proposal to end dog poop on the street. I would pay 10 per month for that pet that I care for. I don't see much more sense, although some want to equate the dogs with the cars. Those who do not value the dogs won't do it for more fees they pay.
<br>I don't really want everyone's money to go to education courses for dog owners. I think there are priority needs to devote everyone' s money. I would simplify things if you're not civic with your dog that you won't be allowed to have more. I just think that it seems to me that the course is unnecessary.

 the city council would organize them it would be to do without having professionals who know their work well. perfect that kennels and protectors organize them, this proposal is not for them to stop doing it, . 
<br>  the town council offers training opportunities to owners, the approach and the content of them should be studied, see the needs that there are, that they have been seen the lack of respect of each other, . 
<br> canine municipal schools exist in other localities providing a necessary service for the great demand there is. I understand that you do not like the idea, you will see it as competition, . 
<br>  the obvious, is very complex and very difficult, you have to know how to read the dog, look at its body posture, its emotional state, . 
<br>  the proposal could be a great first step and a wonderful approach for many people with dogs (s), and also for those who do not have or wish to have, to a series of responsibilities .
<br> I is a professional) cynismos of the style "I invite you"... . 
<br>  I believe that they do not contribute much and it is, in the end, to get lost in banalities . 
<br>  in the proposal it says to learn about dog psychology, which is not turkey mucus, . 
<br> I is a simple label, you look at details that deviate you from the topic I want to propose: "municipal canine education courses", it is a lot of information that can be accessed on the internet and anyone can find it if you fix the courses of responsible tenure are courses of education. I see some needs and I wish you every success in your work. great idea! many dog owners would love to receive some lessons to learn how to treat their pet . 
<br> dog poop on the street. Please vote it out and give it out. very good proposal. Education is fundamental. Greetings alberto, please do not multiply your message over and over again, hinder the dialogue . 
<br>  the owners of the dogs should be fined who carry them loose and without muzzle, besides those who leave the streets of madrid made a tern, more control by the city council. no proposal . 
<br> no, Troll is dedicated to responding to all the comments of others with that little phrase or you are several who seem to know only to say that... if by making a proposal you mean to start one . 
<br>  no, Troll have supported many others... just as there are so many since I think nothing more than to propose... maybe some people should read a little more what others put before putting 7 "different proposals" that are actually the same, because in that way all they achieve is to divide the supports... and well, you don't deserve

Thank you, bil. as a canine educator I see it for nothing.Animal behavior is very complex.What if I bet is for courses on responsible trend, I have given them in kennels and protectors and
<br> it is not like cesar millan that comes to a house, it makes the dog indefension and arranged.. I don't see it as a competition, I dedicate myself to the canine sports world and to working dogs, I just say the obvious, the etology is very complex and very difficult, you have to know how to read the dog, look at its body posture,

<br>. a very good proposal to end dog poop on the street. Please vote it out and give it out. Very good proposal. Education is fundamental. voted: participatory proposal that helps solve the problem: do you disseminate it?:. this is the only proposal relating to animal rights which has a proposal on animal rights. vote: yes, this is a good proposal 
<br> a course of those characteristics will be a kind of permission to have them. I would simplify things if you're not civic with your dog that you won't be allowed to have more, so the rest of the citizens don t have to put up with shit, loose dogs, and typical phrases like 'if you do nothing'. I don't think that people who have dogs have

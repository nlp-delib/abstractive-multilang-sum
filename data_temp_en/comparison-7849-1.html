I'm sorry, I use the bike lane, and if there's no bike lane I'll use the road, but you're the ones who don't respect it, because you invade the bicycle lane when you can't walk through it. You're wearing a hat and a hat, and you really don't have to generalize.
<br>In other countries the bike lane is not on the sidewalk, but on the road. The helmet is not mandatory in madrid, except for those under 16 years of age. If it is mandatory at night, it doesn't make sense not to wear them. The idea is not bad but proposed in another way would be better.
<br>The biggest offender is not the cyclist; only for a few who do the goat. In general, I repeat that I am not talking about you in particular but about what I see day by day, do not comply with the rules. I think the truth, especially for children, seems to me to be in favor of banning running on the streets.
<br>I must understand that the bike is an alternative to the car, motorcycle, or public transport. True, motorcycles reach higher speeds than bicycles, and therefore the risk of falling with injury/death increases. bicycles do not reach speeds as high as cars or motorcycles, so the possibility of injury in the event of an accident is less. this relationship is one that allows not to use the helmet to cyclists, provided that the basic traffic rules are met.
<br>The vast majority of accidents suffered by cyclists, are a consequence of the behaviors of other cars. I am also in favour of coexistence, but it is logical and reasonable also that there are certain things that are not logical. I honestly do not think that madrid is a city for bicycles, for its orography and influx of citizens.

 a cyclist is more distracted or any qualifier you want to put us on, it's not true, because there are people walking that is much more distracted, .

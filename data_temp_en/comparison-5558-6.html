Throwing firecrackers on the street is forbidden by municipal ordinances. I think it would be more appropriate to regulate the sale of pyrotechnic products to private individuals. The issue of surveillance through cameras, seems to me something excessive, worthy of great brother. I aspire to have more civic neighbors who respect and care for the city in terms of cleaning issues.
<br>I'm going to set an example that happened to me on January 3rd and that perfectly illustrates the situation that happens dozens of times in the streets of madrid every day. I was walking on the sidewalk when I heard several meters behind me blow a firecracker. I followed walking and, a couple of meters ahead, blew another one in the middle of the bike lane. Right at that time, on the road, I overstepped a police car, with the driver's window down. The car didn't stop. There is only one possible explanation: they were deaf.

 totally agree, the acoustic pollution is of the highest in cities like madrid. controlling these things makes it much more conducive the coexistence without doubt... throwing firecrackers on the street is forbidden . 
<br>  totally unheard of that they never see the same in front of their noses. in order to enforce this prohibition, it would be necessary to have a policeman on every street . 
<br> I'm am open to ideas or suggestions to get them to start putting them (at best, my proposal is not the best). I called again for the same reason . 
<br>  the proposal will improve something that comments more for the police by fines and sanction the following behaviors. Maybe that scares me very much.I don't want a police state without any civil rights.I do not want this to end up becoming a state similar to v de vendetta. or vendetta v. a complementary noise.multiply .

Maybe this proposal will improve something that comments more for the police by fines and sanction the following behaviors. I am not in favour of giving more to any professional for carrying out tasks that are within his competence, that is, that it is his obligation to carry them out: it would be

<br>  it is the only way that I think to tackle this problem. in England people are respectful of cleanliness and noises .

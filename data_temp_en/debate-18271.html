- if they should not be used in a country with such a warm climate as ours, almost desert, I don't know where they should be used... since we are, why doesn't it propose to eliminate heating that pollutes much more than air conditioning? I think it would be more logical with its thinking.
<br>- I see that you ask in two proposals to remove coal boilers. Do you know the coal or gas that has to be burned in power plants to produce all the megawatts hour that air conditioners need to work? or do you know spent fuel (used uranium) that is generated in nuclear plants to make those megawattes? is it not better a fan of 300 w to a device of 3000 w?have you children, I have children, and I hope to have grandchildren, I want you to reach old people on this planet.our way of life is not sustainable, it is not renewable. we are so fast degrading, generating garbage, that the planet does not have the capacity to regenerate.
<br>- this is okay, and it's wrong, if the house were well isolated, it wouldn't be so much needed, in my house is a room, and its roof is not well insulated, and living at more than 40 degrees......., it is hell, I don't know if you know it but it has consequences for health, even hanging towels from the terrace door, alters sleep, disturbs stress, and more consequences the more population at risk you are, so in some countries working at over 45 degrees is forbidden, children are given heat strokes in schools, in mine every year, and that's at 11 am, I can't imagine my father and my daughter living something similar daily, what is there is to help to be able to improve the isolation of her vvda., I'll tell you another case, some people lived in a house where they had glass windows, they were new, and they assured that the window was special for the heat, and there even with air conditioning, why a sr. had a thermometer of the water type, and came out.
<br>- TV showed how that crystal was at 55 degrees, 55, which, I don't know if it's an old man's death, isn't the first time seniors in the south die on the street, tries to read at over 40 degrees, and you'll notice the effects on your brain, that's a sign that your brain is overheated, and what for you is a lack of concentration, and bad mood, for a child or an elderly person is a heat stroke, my home is 43 degrees, calmly, and knowing that every year it is heat stroke I put it at 26 degrees, is my way of taking care of my family, and let us bear in mind that it is not only cold kills, the heat also does here, in Spain, to kill people with heat strokes, I feel so frank.
<br>- we will have to start by asking that all the buildings that are built are isolated in conditions, and not like everything that is built, that for a few years the buildings with viewpoints have been fashionable, that to everyone seems very nice, but that makes that between all the cold and the heat, especially in a city like madrid, and nobody does anything, nor is it heard about it. when you buy a floor is that no one looks at the kind of isolation that has, not even in the windows and viewpoints, and then come some very expensive energy bills, why does no one complain?
<br>- air conditioning uses electrical energy, which can come from renewable sources or not. However, in the case of natural gas heating, these never come from Renewable sources. It is dirty and war-causing energy.
<br>- I understand the concept of your proposal but I do not share it, it already pays taxes both in its acquisition, installation and of course during its use, so I think that in order to limit the heat we receive on the street its installation should be on the roofs and thus better dissipate the heat they produce. a greeting.
<br>- This doesn't work, whoever's got the money will keep buying it, and on top of it throwing the heat to which one can't be paid.
<br>- air conditioners make the city's average temperature in summer rise 2 degrees. closing blinds, creating air currents (where you can) you can manage to lower the temperature. and you can move the air through fans. the truth is that this so artificial and dry cold is not beneficial for health either.
<br>- the household appliance that most consumes in the home is the "fridge", consumes 1,300 w for 24 hours for 365 days. the air conditioning consumes 3,500 w for 10 hours per day in the summer period (3 months). the kw-h is at 0.112, so we have. refrigerator (60% factor use) = 765 /year; air conditioning (80% factor usage) = 283 /year. the real contaminant of air conditioning are the escapes of fluorinated gases, but thanks to the Kyoto protocol and the rite is very controlled its manufacture and recharges of the circuit. the thermal installations (heating and cooling) are necessary for the health of the people and are also mandatory by the technical code of the building (cte db hs2).<br>

I do not see it sensible, is to move the fear of the cyclist by the car, to the pedestrian by the bicycle.

 the bike lanes are shown, and even greater of the bike sidewalk. I have lost the fear of travelling along the road, and I make myself respect enough as I respect the basic rules of circulation.. I apologize for that "beast"... I do not see it sensible, is to gain space to the car, not to the pedestrian. It seems very dangerous, but once you get used to it it is not so much
<br> the road is not an option for me or for many like me, I have seen several cyclists hit on madrid and, although they do not come out in the newspapers, I saw it from the bus.

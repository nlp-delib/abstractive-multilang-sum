- if you leave specific spaces so that the graffiti painters paint is worth me, but that paint where they want not, that then we are the owners of the real estate that we have to clean the wreckage. who decides if a painted is beautiful or artistic? to me may not like (in fact most are a horror). graffiti are vandalistic acts that want to sell us as street art. madrid free of paints that the money spent on cleaning them would be better used in social works..
<br>- you can give them guidelines to paint and not, it is something that they are doing many shops in their locks and doors and it works so that they do not paint on vandal graffiti. in madrid there are many areas that are already painted with permission and are quite decorative, I talk above all about public areas not in private areas. the intention is not to have to spend money on cleaning painted and have fewer areas that have graffiti that are either a horror or that are simply a signature.
<br>If I have a business and I want my white wall, why do I have to change it?
<br>- I understand what it has decided at all times, but I insist that I speak of public areas, such as the walls under the bridges of roads, or areas in Madrid that are full of painted and could be improved, or facades of ruined buildings, or the external walls of schools...... I am talking about projects such as those that have done boaming in the barley market. I invest a lot in repainting those walls when once every two years they could let them decorate and thus save on it. I am not talking about private areas, nor shops, nor houses, nor anything like that, that many shops are doing it is an example nothing more..
<br>- they can paint the wall of their room. In this way they could contemplate their work of art every day. regarding painting the walls and facades of the houses... I tell you what we spent in our community to leave it as it was before these gentlemen painted us? solution: fines and if there is recidivism, a few months in a juvenile center.
<br>- not everyone has so much art. and painting a facade that is of everyone, it is not admissible. respect. as always. that paints in his house. the public also owns: all.
<br>- Okay, well, don't support it, but you're not going to convince anyone, just like I do, neither do I like an initiative and not support it.
<br>- I think that the only solution to the painted ones is in the long term and it is about "education in respect", the rest are only momentary. cleaning, costed with money either public or of each neighbor, until another enlightened one who thinks he is a great creative and condemns us to see his "art". what some shops do, paying for them to paint their closures and facades more artistically, is nothing more than another form of extortion, if you pay me and I paint you I will not make you another graffiti. if not to ask in our neighborhoods. while we do not assume that the public is of all, also the money used in cleaning, that could be dedicated in social matters, quite necessary, especially today, this will not have solution.
<br>- That's not art. They're frustrated looking for their personality according to psychological analysis. We'd have to educate them and increase the fines. Besides, there's a mafia who's dedicated to painting shop doors in exchange for doing something nice and not a scribble.
<br>- Well, I'll let you spoil it, it's clear that you haven't understood the end of the proposal, you can look at the attached links that I've left you for if you're interested in knowing what I mean, if not, it seems very good that you think what you want, but I think this page was not made in a forocoche or afeminine plan where everyone criticizes everyone. Surely it doesn't come to the number of votes needed, so don't worry about the proposal any more, in return, you will continue to take your facade with names of war, regardless of whether this initiative takes place or not...... I just ask you to inform yourselves before insulting or deviating. That a business paints its closure with something showy is advertising for the night because people fix themselves, not a mafia or a corruption. And that you put someone in a correctional to paint on a wall is a thought too radical knowing that there is so much criminal (truly) to laugh at us.
<br>- the graffittis are privatization of the city "from below". seems interesting to me your proposal, but not for people to paint or sign wherever they want, but for them to do it in an area dedicated to what they call "urban art" and which also has its fans.
<br>- madrid free of paints would be sad... color brings. it goes in taste but I love berlin where they are legal and nobody complains. it also serves as tourist claim. painting a protected monument seems to me out of place. but otherwise, madrid is a canvas!.
<br>- I used to live in a montreal, and there what they did, which seemed curious to me, is the following: every year they chose a few especially tempting walls for graffiti artists (tapias, some wall offered by some community of neighbors, etc.) and they offered themselves to international artists, who had a week to paint them. this event, which took place every spring, became a festival, which ended up creating a particularly artistic neighborhood in the city.
<br>- hi marta, that's exactly what I mean, in my neighborhood, vallecas villa, they are already doing it and the change is brutal, now the facades of the schools and nurseries have motivating drawings and phrases. and some walls have yielded to associations to decorate them every x time and I like to see how they change and every day are better. It is a pity that you can not attach photos in the proposals because it is really worth seeing them, but I have attached the location of an institute in my neighbourhood so that you see that I mean. thanks for your comment.
<br>- I mean free of unnecessary paint and signatures in places where they really dirty the facade, clearly I don't want it free of paints, I mean something else like the route of the graffiti of brussels or the child of the grenade paintings, which is a little bit more or less what is doing boaming around the world and we have them here in madrid, we should take advantage of that art.
<br>- a proposal added to the list of unrepealed proposals. sure, that yesterday I saw on the TV that they have invited several international artists to paint the walls of the old industrial tobacco ship in the gloriette of ambassadors (see if one day I approach to see how it has remained).

<br>- the only permissible space for the shrimps called "graphiters" to paint, is their own house, what makes them suppose that others like their art=basura?, what presumptuous!.
<br>- who paints in his house, I like the painted ones in the buildings, however "motivating" they are for some.
<br>- who paints in his house, we don't want his art=basura.
<br>- it's not enough for us not to support her, we want them to stop soiling the city and extorting.
<br>- create a proposal then, buddy.
<br>- I agree with luis yago, create your proposal against the painted ones and point. there are many proposals that I do not agree with and I don't focus on criticizing them all, I only read the next one until I can support some that seems good. this is called freedom of expression, if I think something I say, if people support me, well, if not, nothing happens. but there are a lot of people who get bored and just worry about criticizing, missing and insulting, that should not be the task of all this. respect that you do not approve according to your freedom of speech, but that doesn't help this development of proposals, as I said in your day, are many necessary supports and I find it almost impossible to accept it so stop worrying just as I do with the proposals that do not like. thanks.
<br>- Thank you manjichiba!!!! I'll go see him too..
<br>- You're welcome.<br>

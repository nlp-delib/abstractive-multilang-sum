- I think we need the northern Castilian district, but the icon of our city is the alcal√° door.
<br>- it seems that you have not put your feet in your life at madrid, because icons is precisely what is left of you. from the royal palace, palace of cybels, door of alcala, churches, monasteries, palaces, the historical helmet (the largest in Europe, the great road, alleys, corners. buy a ticket and go spend a weekend and you will see that of things you are going to see.
<br>- indeed, it has many icons but none significant enough to be known worldwide. it seems that you have not put your feet in your life outside of Spain. buy a ticket and ask foreigners for madrid. no offense;). I am madrid and I love madrid to live, but I recognize that at tourist level it loses in relation to other European capitals or with barcelona within our own borders. is a proposal that in my opinion can contribute to improving my city, it is not necessary to support it or share it. a greeting.
<br>- Well, look, I've lived 17 years out of Spain, so get in touch before you say anything.
<br>- and having lived out, which is not the same as asking people of different nationalities, do you really believe that the door of alcala is equivalent to the coliseum, the tower eiffel or the sacred family (to mention some emblematic icons)? if you think that madrid is at the head of the tourist attraction then I say nothing more, but the figures are what they are. I have not lived out but I have traveled a lot and every time they ask me for the most important of madrid I remain doubtful, what I would see if I only had 30 seconds, the icon that would draw on a tourist map... madrid has many and excellent things to see, but I think it lacks that something. a greeting and not sulphire you.
<br>- and you don't get obsessed. Get away once and for all you and those who are like you that obsession you have with madrid and live without complexes! greetings.
<br>- it is true what the author of this proposal says. I have worked with foreigners settled in Spain and everyone tells me that madrid has no tourist pull. when speaking of Spain, it is first thought in barcelona and then in sevilla or in the guggenheim of bilbao.madrid, what it needs is a universal exhibition that leaves as inheritance an important icon. since with the Olympics we have not managed, at least try it with a universal exposition.
<br>- Well, look, I think it's a very good proposal, even better than mine. I would certainly support it;).
<br>- I'll leave you this proposal in case you're interested.
<br>- I have been living in many cities, and madrid I think it can be a city that can give much more of itself. many foreigners and many spaols, consider that madrid is dry, madrid has no great river, nor a great lake, like most of the cities. I think that it could be invested in improving the manzanares river and making it bigger, or creating a large lake, what transforms the capital, and dividing the city history with the modern one as happened in the capital of brazil, brasilia, which because of climate issues artificially created a great Lake in the middle of the city. and with respect to an icon, the Spanish capital needs a great modern icon, a futuristic architectural icon that can be bigger than the world.<br>

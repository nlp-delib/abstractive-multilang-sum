 incivism. For the debate, what is worse is a cyclist who jumps a traffic light when no-one comes on the road that crosses or a pedestrian crosses a street in red when no one comes and/or without pedestrians? a purpose of traffic rules, is to avoid accidents. which skip them can be due to several reasons, may lack traffic lights and when having to move away it crosses improper
<br> bikes can never go on the sidewalk, but please, the first thing we start to impose fines to offenders who run around where they want to go without respecting the rules of movement. they respect nothing or anyone. they have to run along the road and comply with the regulations of movement like everyone else. bicycles must respect traffic rules because they are vehicles, vulnerable, but vehicles and more vulnerable are still pedestrians..
<br> there are no cops to regulate it, and they go a fashion.I drive a bike, but also a car and a motorcycle.The traffic rules are clear and include bicycles.They are vehicles and they are forbidden to travel along the sidewalks.Is it so difficult to understand?. Mobility officers and the municipal police should ensure to avoid the incivic behaviors of all those who skip the rules.

Many car users do not respect traffic lights or speed limits and park in pedestrian and sidewalk steps, endangering pedestrians and cyclists and causing accidents. cars, even if they have motor and registration, are four-wheeled vehicles and are bound by the same traffic rules as motorcycles or bicycles. Mobility agents and municipal police should ensure to avoid the incivic behaviour of some car drivers.
<br>Bicycles must respect traffic rules because they are vehicles, vulnerable, but vehicles and more vulnerable are still pedestrians. Many other car drivers also do not respect the rules of traffic (non-signal laps, speed limits, etc.) and we have not created a police aimed at chasing them. When a cyclist fails to comply with a normal traffic code, an administrative penalty can be imposed on him.
<br>I'm sick of bikes being put on, because madrid isn't prepared for it or his people. It's like a fashion, but there's no bike lane, and there are no cops to regulate it. You have to be the one to give in if you don't want an accident. Anyone who can cause an accident, are not more preferable than others.

<br>i believe that with good intention the two can live together . i drive a bike , but also a car and a motorcycle
<br>i do not want to risk my life , nor go out on the road . i do n't want to kill my life '
<br>i believe it is because they know they are n't going to sanction them
<br>if they do n't comply with the rule , it 's because they knew they are not going to sanct them
<br>i 'm sick of bikes being put on sidewalks because madrid is n't prepared for it or his people

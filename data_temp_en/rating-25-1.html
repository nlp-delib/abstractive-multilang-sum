- totally agree. there is no right to be paid real fortunes for the meals of our children and/or elders and what they receive in return is food - mess, nutritionally incomplete and whose benefit only affects the turn contract, rather than the health of those who have to eat it.
<br>- I remember that in my school, when we were little (because then they took it off) we had a garden and we ate what we grew. There was no child who didn't know where the food came from.
<br>- the public children's school "the sun" of chamantin already has an ecological menu, and the concerted monserrat has it at all levels for a year. It is technically possible, and at almost the same price (less than 5 euros extra cost per child) only need will.
<br>- it is not important but it is absolutely necessary. to educate the most small people in responsible consumption, local, sustainable, etc. should be one of the main tasks, but the one that most. aside, it is obvious that the health of the small people is fundamental and with that you do not play or bargain: we are what we eat..
<br>- is a very appropriate and intelligent measure from many points of view: it is good for children, for society and for the planet. we will get it. thank you very much promoters.
<br>- What luck. What school was it?
<br>- totally in agreement that the bodies of municipal ownership follow ecological criteria, proximity and social economy in their public purchases in the services of school dining in children's schools and in the distribution of meals of the social and health services dependent on the city council and that it is included in the tenders. thanks for the news about the school the sun of sachamatin and the monstserrat. in my daughter's public school the price for being in the dining room is more or less 4.5 euros, with the detail that if one takes his own food to eat there the price is almost equal, 3.5 euros! it seems that the food only costs 1 euro per day and the rest is taken by the staff of the dining and care..
<br>- a school can have its own kitchen or bring food from outside and warm it up. we want it ourselves.the kitchen can cook the menu from raw food or use pre-cooked.we want it from raw foods.the food can be any or ecological. the ecological ones.the foods can come from very far away or from a smaller radius (200 km?) around madrid. we love them close.and above all, the children can enjoy a good food or a bad food.We want them to enjoy!!
<br>- I offer you another way to generate employment and help families without resources. Considering that in Madrid, independent food banks that operate have only 4 employees and 450 volunteers, the creation of a municipally run and public food bank would generate an environment number of 500 jobs for the coordination of the collection, storage and delivery of food to families with no resources.
<br>- the proposal is interesting but I fear that we are forgetting issues that are priorities for the lives of many families without resources that cannot feed their children. I remind you that Spain is the country of the ocde where inequality has advanced the most during the crisis. Inequality in Spain is advancing at a rate that exceeds 14 times to Greece. poverty and exclusion in Spain have increased alarmingly in recent years, with 13.4 million people at risk of exclusion in 2014 (29.2% of the Spanish population) as the report "an economy serving 1%" made public in 2016 by Oxfam intermon. On the other hand, we are waiting for us to apply 10 billion euros in cuts from Europe. we can continue to obviate this issue, think that nothing happens but now is the time to put in place actions against poverty:<br>

she says at an early age it may be good for children to work with books on paper better than with electronic devices .
<br>it can lead to vision problems mainly, in addition, the prolonged use of these devices which would imply having all the books in the nervous system .
<br>it and tb fix the environment .
<br>using new technologies is ecological, why is it insane? .the school books in seems to me a good proposal, it would even allow the power to update them without having to be buying new books every year .
<br>they will be spoiled the business of selling the same book to you again and again, simply changing the layout and little
<br>still, is the competence of the city council a measure like the proposal?. .

 if there are free digital libraries. Of course... computers and mobiles barely emit radiation. At first they said it produced brain cancer, but the technique changes, that I don't know. digital books in pdf and digital boards to see pdfs. wonderful. I think that at an early age it may be good for children to work with books on paper better than with electronic devices because of the dangers they may have, and
<br> the editorials will be very funny, although they will continue to model and make books because with my proposal we eliminate only the printing on paper. the other steps will remain in effect, but I hope that with a substantial reduction of costs... I hope!!!. the school books in pdf seems to me a good proposal, it would even allow the power to update them without having to be buying new books every year simply because they have

 I is it insane? it can lead to vision problems mainly, in addition, the prolonged use of these devices which would imply having all the books in pdf long periods of exposure to radiofrequency waves and electromagnetic fields that cause long-term problems of the nervous system and fertility. So .

this proposal may not fall within the competence of our city council
<br>but if you can support it to change the education system and that of the competences a hoax
<br>the prolonged use of these devices would entail long periods of exposure to radiofrequency waves and electromagnetic fields that generate, which could cause long-term problems of the nervous system and fertility
<br>by experience , not all children and adolescents adapt to the electronic format
<br>it would even allow the power to update them without having to be buying new books every year
<br>although they will continue to model and make books because with my proposal we eliminate only the printing on paper

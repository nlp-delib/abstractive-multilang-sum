- it may be a bit controversial, since there are human rights and the right to religion I do not like and support the proposal either.
<br>- If it were for safety, we'd have to ban scarves.
<br>- and here many rights, but women carry burka in their breasts, not men.
<br>- to compare the sadistic and shameful drama of women in certain countries with a woman who carries a burka in a more developed country in feminism (although it is very much to be done) seems to me exaggerated. if it is forbidden to whom should punish the law, the husband, the father? because they are able to, on top of it, impose a fine on the poor woman who wears burka, as they do with prostituted women, besides whore we put the bed, never better said.
<br>- the problem is where the limit is placed on the integral veil? if you cover your hair and mouth is okay? and if it's just hair, neck and ears?I don't know if you should ban, but of course you have to take steps to minimize all the negative facets that this type of dress carries.
<br>- I think it is not a case of economic punishment or punishment, but it is only a project in which women with such a garment are denied entry, not everything is arranged with the desire to collect.
<br>- Please do not link to proposals that are not directly related. thank you..
<br>- although I agree that the use of the burka is forbidden, I would like you to know that the majority of women who wear it is by their own will, that they do not prostrate to go out on the street without going dressed like this, they would feel naked. I think this is because they have been subjected so long (15 centuries), that this way of seeing life is already in their adn, it is sad but I am convinced that it is so. about the prohibition, I think that in a secular state, these manifestations of religious character should remain from doors inside, including all, processions, horseback ridings, bells to go to Mass, etc..
<br>- I think what should be banned or stopped is going with the face covered. not a kind of concrete garment. I have never seen women with burka in Spain. some with the "black ninja" costume that around the area look like tourists..
<br>- very good the phrase: "... maltreatment, archaic and medieval, to the woman.... absolutely agree. who wants to come to live to the west and specifically to madrid who does it knowing how to behave, if he does not assume, not to come.<br>

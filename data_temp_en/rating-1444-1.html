- regardless of the beauty or not of the monument, the truth is that since it was put a terrible bottleneck was created in that roundabout, since lanes were removed, and entering well is a little war. I support the reform..
<br>- I think what happens to him from the outside is dirt from the exhaust pipes of the vehicles.
<br>- I was just going to propose the reform of the monument when I saw that it was already created, so my support is clear for it to change. It is very ugly and unworthy of the biggest attack in Spanish history. Simply, and as a simple proposal if water were added to it that was falling from the monument as a metaphor of the life and memory of the victims and light at night would be enough, but that it be reformed please!!!.
<br>- the truth that the monument is quite ugly, and I also support the proposal to change or make modifications so that we know what it is, since many people who visit us from outside Madrid have no idea what that monument means. let's do something nice in memory of the victims of the biggest attack that has been in Spain.
<br>- is another of the horrible perlites that have been built in madrid, like the "obelisk" of callatrava in castilla square. I think it does not dignify anything the city nor much less the homage that was intended to make to the victims of that fateful date. a great missed opportunity to create an emblem of the city. great historical error..
<br>- totally agree, bottling is tremendous, I don't know who designed it but it's to remove the license. Besides, the monument is terribly ugly. my support.
<br>- this monument was built on the basis of an architectural contest. the winning team designed a monument that doesn't look like the one built. the rushes to lift the monument forced a great builder to simplify it to intolerable limits. already the idea project pointed to a very difficult execution, which was translated into a bluff thanks to the incompetence of the builder, the indefinacy of the project, and its initial unfeasibility. the site could not be more aggressive and inhospitable. in short, it does not represent anyone, dirty the memory, does not bring anything. a great missed opportunity.
<br>- ugly, really ugly and not emotional at all. to top it is always ruined and now we are told that they will pay 200,000 euros to fix it??!!!!!! nor talk! there are many more useful things to do with that money. I really prefer that they take that sum and give it to the relatives of the victims but please don't dedicate a hard to the giant trash.
<br>- I have not yet found anyone of any political sign that tells me that it is beautiful. in that square there is that monument for that which add to the name of the station "madrid touches martyrs of the 11m and already this. already there is another less ugly monument (which also in the retreat) and release that square from that kind of dirty fireplace. the inside could be dedicated to cultural or tourist information for the visitors who arrive.
<br>- they should replace it already because it is a pity that it looks dirty and broken, the haste left this impersonal and ugly monument without it transmitting any feeling, besides I think nobody likes it.<br>

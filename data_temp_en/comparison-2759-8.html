 the bike lanes are shown, and even greater of the bike sidewalk. I have lost the fear of travelling along the road, and I make myself respect enough as I respect the basic rules of circulation.. I apologize for that "beast"... I do not see it sensible, is to gain space to the car, not to the pedestrian. It seems very dangerous, but once you get used to it it is not so much
<br> the road is not an option for me or for many like me, I have seen several cyclists hit on madrid and, although they do not come out in the newspapers, I saw it from the bus. I support the proposal and launch this supplementary. a proposal for a real regulation of light electric vehicles, which are already on the market and which are currently, in madrid, in limbo, when in

I do not see it sensible, is to move the fear of the cyclist by the car, to the pedestrian by the bicycle. I like your encouragement to use the road, I also encourage everyone since it is the best way to be safer. The sidewalks for pedestrians and roads better share them with cars (with or without separation)
<br>I think the problem is that cyclists in many cases believe that they are the kings of circulation. I think that the minimum width so that they can circulate bicycles on the sidewalk is 3 meters. I support the proposal for a real regulation of light electric vehicles. We are already more than 3,000 supporters of this proposal.

it is a very sensible proposal but it seems to me that the solution is to gain space to the car
<br>i would be more in favour of lane-bikes on the road , perhaps protected to ensure that the cars do not invade it
<br>and at a certain distance from the parked cars (because of the danger of opening a door).on the other hand
<br>i mean wide sidewalks and always with priority for the pedestrian
<br>it would be in places where these lanes do not exist
<br>i support the proposal and ask for another who asks for a safe bike lane network for all madrid

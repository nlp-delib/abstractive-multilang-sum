 voted. in rent we have this problem with the dirt and lewdness of the neighborhood, please vote: with private or public companies. the private would understand it as a business (maybe it was interesting though I do not know what is wrong with the management of a religious organization). in madrid there are a lot of organizations that will pick up the enchanted clothes. the previous containers withdre
<br> a waste that you can recycle. you should collect the broken and useless clothes to recycle it and that it does not end in the garbage. a whole business. this if it is in the hands of the city council would not happen. I remain calm, but as the management of my residue by practitioners. the proper management does not mean to destroy or transform, it can also be reused as is the case with the used

 the first to say that I am in favour of these containers again, but there are containers for people to deposit the clothes. in addition, this makes it visible . 
<br>  more people make donations (if it is really necessary, of course, I do not know the data about it). it would be good if this service were provided, and the containers depended on some unprofitable NGO . 
<br> the worn clothes are left over in many of the wardrobes of all Spain. there . 
<br>  the used pneumatics that are still in use. it is not necessary to mask with ong's or charity the proper management. it takes many containers but it does not need to be seen as a donation .

It would be good if this service were provided, and the containers depended on some unprofitable NGO and were detached from religious organizations. Currently in madrid hundreds of clothes are managed by religious organizations, and so far they have not bitten anyone who has gone to get clothes;) In rent we have this problem with the dirt and lewdness of the neighborhood, please vote:with private or public companies.
<br>The worn clothes are left over in many of the wardrobes of all Spain. The correct management does not mean to destroy or transform, it can also be reused as is the case with the used pneumatics that are still in use. It is not necessary to mask with ong's or charity the proper management.

there are a lot of organizations that will pick up the contaminated clothes
<br>it seems that it took advantage of the donated clothes for its own benefit and did not fulfill its original purpose
<br>sure that in the parish of each neighborhood will be happy to pick it up
<br>the e.g. says " the worn clothes is a residue " and must be managed by professionals
<br>it can also be reused as is the case with the used pneumatics that are still in use
<br>it takes many containers but it does not need to be seen as a donation and so i remain calm

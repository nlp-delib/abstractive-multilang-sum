- first we would have to fine all those who use bicycles by failing to comply with the traffic code, i.e. 90% of the users.
<br>- I'm sorry, I use the bike lane, and if there's no bike lane I'll use the road, but you're the ones who don't respect it, because you invade the bicycle lane when you can't walk through it, so your bike lane name, plus when a parking driver doesn't decide anything about it and is much more dangerous than a cyclist.
<br>- Why repeat proposed? please avoid repeating proposals.You can edit one of them by giving the green button from top to right "edit" and put "eliminated" in addition to leaving blank all the content.
<br>- I don't doubt that you're that 10% but you'll see just as much as I'm the one who doesn't get properly dressed, skips traffic lights, or uses them to crucify like a pedestrian and continue, or is jamming traffic or being a potential danger to the number of children, the elderly and adults while riding on the sidewalk mounted on the bike.
<br>- You're wearing a hat and a hat, and you really don't have to generalize.
<br>- Sorry to disagree with your opinion, but that a cyclist is more distracted or any qualifier you want to put us on, it's not true, because there are people walking that is much more distracted, that if you speak for the whatapp, if you're talking for the mobile, that when you are talking to someone, or infinity of things more, it distracts a lot more, so much so that on many occasions and seen pedestrians that they are almost hit by looking at the mobile as they pass through a zebra step with the traffic light of the pedestrians passing in green for them, because they walk so slowly because they are hanging from the mobile while writing, or another example that I can put to you is when they're writing and they come forward with a lighthouse for not seeing what's in front of their noses, that a rider watches it and doesn't happen, because it goes a thousand times more pending than a pedestrian and can even help you to not stick with the lighthouse, or we'll be able to say, "re sorry."
<br>- I have not generalized all cyclists, I have based myself on my personal experience and opinions rendered by colleagues, family, friends... when talking about this topic. chaqu√© and cap at least jejeje although some reflectant and helmet would not be too much.
<br>- I have not talked about distracted, a pedestrian on the sidewalk can go as distracted as he wants if he hits someone is at 5 km/h and with the body not with a metal instrument like a bike and at a higher speed. that a pedestrian can cause an accident or hurt?? of course yes, but minor and in his "way of circulation" the pedestrian causes many less problems and is "the weakest" as he loves to say to the cyclist collective when they defend themselves from the drivers. but in order not to deviate from the topic that I think we are doing. fine the pedestrian, when the biggest offender is the cyclist, seems to me a mistake.
<br>- and what do we do with cyclists who go on the sidewalks or on the road? monetary penalty also do not understand that many people still have to learn to use these tools that the new city council gives us, but to use it correctly we have to take into account 2 things/rules/standards that are pure logic and coherence:1-do not repeat proposals please, because if no one receives the support that they deserve.2-either for good or for bad when it is proposed is done with logic, with coherence and objectivity. in my personal opinion the interesting proposal is that seeks the good of the city and of coexistence in general not the one that seeks to satisfy personal frustrations. the idea is not bad but proposed in another way would be better, give it a couple of turns and sure you come up with a better focused proposal. a greeting and a hug.
<br>- in other countries the bike lane is not on the sidewalk, but on the road.So pedestrians are not allowed to use it.
<br>- the helmet is not mandatory in madrid, except for those under 16 years of age. wear reflective if it is mandatory at night....it doesn't make sense not to wear them.
<br>- the greater offender the cyclist, you will tell me why? when the pedestrian according to the mobility ordinance fails to comply with the greater but all the rules, like not stopping in groups to speak, run, jump or do any kind of act that bother the many users of the road, crossing sidewalk without using the pedestrian passage, you want me to follow? because I have the ordinance in front, so as I say again the biggest offender is not the cyclist; only for a few who do the goat you already get us all, when we do not even half of the nonsense of those who do others, we only enjoy our favorite sport without disturbing anyone, but if there are people who put themselves in the bicycle lane, as you will understand I will not remain silent if I have to get off the bike because there is a group of people talking about their life and in terms of clothes the helmet as another user says, it is mandatory for minors, the reflectant, the lights are not mandatory with little visibility.
<br>- we already know that it is not correct the ordinance that regulates many things, in my opinion it has no logic that circulates by the way without helmet, besides for safety it is a matter of equality. a motorcycle that has to carry both helmet and light always on, it is quite agile on many occasions when it has a motor that helps you that a cyclist, and to them if it is forced, like the respect of a traffic light, if for all it is mandatory for the bikes it should be so, if I am obliged to circulate at least half the speed of the road, a cyclist should also accept it or not be able to use that road, but as I say, this is a problem of ordinances not of the user, which will understand if you kill yourself because you do not wear the helmet or take it forward because you are not visible, to me it does not matter, since it is your fault, as if you fall a driver or crash a car and get fired by not wearing a belt.
<br>- greater offender because in general, I repeat that I am not talking about you in particular but about what I see day by day, do not comply with the rules, I do not say that pedestrians are an example, I am tired of people who circulate on the left for example, but the harm and damage that they can cause is minimal. the thing about running, jumping.... I think the truth, especially for children, seems to me to be in favor of banning running on the streets. how I will understand I cannot agree with "only we enjoy our favorite sport without bothering anyone" because many citizens do not think so. I think we should change the laws and seek the best coexistence, giving both, although now what remains good and politically correct is to put you on your side.
<br>- the cyclists that you comment, are foreigners who use the electric bicycles of the madrid community, or people who wear walking bikes or the little ones that those do not need to wear suitable clothes as you mentioned earlier, those if I agree with you, who are the least to follow the rules of traffic, but in the case of the road bicycles or mountain bikes, like this one mine, if you have to wear special clothes, as to whether the young children who are learning to ride a bike or have been riding on it for a very short time, have to go on the road with the danger of cars, buses, motorcycles, etc. seems to me a shame, since there is this child has not a hint of possibility to go to the minimum speed of the way and can be much more dangerous than for an adult, in that aspect if he would let them go through the sidewalk, but nothing for the safety of the child, and accompanying him who was walking and becoming a pedestrian.
<br>- or we can also make it impossible for a child to drive a car, a motorcycle, a truck.... if there is a minimum age for travelling with most vehicles, like not doing so with bicycles too? this is not the pub where it is summertime but a vertiginous, convulsive city. I am not a supporter of bicycles in madrid, I think I have already said it or it has been made clear in some comment, but I am also a favourer of coexistence and respect to which you do not feel the same, but the principle of an agreement is that they are not discriminated positively in terms of traffic rules.
<br>- I have not said that the traffic order is wrong. in fact, it seems appropriate and follows the example of many other cities in our environment with a greater cycling population.I must understand that the bike is an alternative to the car, motorcycle, or public transport. True, motorcycles reach higher speeds than bicycles, and therefore the risk of falling with injury/death increases. bicycles do not reach speeds as high as cars or motorcycles, so the possibility of injury in the event of an accident is less. this relationship is one that allows not to use the helmet to cyclists, provided that the basic traffic rules are met.I also consider that we are in diapers with respect to other cities, and we have much to invest in the city to take space from the car and bet on the bike as a means of transport.
<br>- if you hit a curb or have an accident in which you hit or hit your head, you will see how you become a loyal defender of the helmet. in my opinion it doesn't make sense that a bike, quite clumsy and insecure compared to the rest of the vehicles, jumps a traffic light and above it without a helmet. so you will have the brilliant brains on the asphalt... I understand the speed of a fall on the tarmac, although you eat the meat with nothing, but a hit on a curb is deadly even for a pedestrian, and with this I don't mean that we should all wear helmets, but if you circulate with companions, bigger, stronger and faster than you, you must be the first one interested in doing it safely.
<br>- that it is known that I usually use the helmet (75 percent of the times I use it). to wear helmet neither ensures survival in all traffic accidents in which there is a bicycle involved. in fact, the vast majority of accidents suffered by cyclists, are a consequence of the behaviors of other cars. what is shown is that there is little respect for the bike by many of the drivers.
<br>- You're right.
<br>- a bicycle does not have half the danger that a car, a motorcycle, or a truck, and less driven by a 5-year-old child, if we're going to put those examples, I can tell you that a woman in the palm of a majorca who has driven in the opposite direction for 2 kilometers or taxi drivers, bus drivers or truck drivers who do not respect the continuous lines on a two-way inter-urban road, those are going to tell me that she is less at risk than a 3- or 5 year-old with a bike and who goes to the care of her father, behind the child and pending him, on top of which most cars don't respect the subway and half the side distance on the roads as a great way, as you want a small child to take the bike around there, or is it that you think just like the cab drivers, that they hinder the step and if they could run over the cyclist they come along? I am also in favour of coexistence, but it is logical and reasonable also that there are certain things that are not logical.
<br>- if you have less protection, less ability to react seem "not half the danger", we think completely different. any of the examples that you have put me could suffer an accident and leave unharmed and a child of 5 years old who will take it ahead of you any vehicle for infringement of the first one would die. I honestly do not think that madrid is a city for bicycles, for its orography and influx of citizens on its streets, much less for children of 3 or 5 years, but as today is what is "politically correct" and what politicians believe that gives votes, we will have to look for a way to live together..
<br>- in my opinion the best would be on the streets of the city as a big road and streets with roads of more than 2 lanes for each direction of the traffic, that it is removed a lane to change it by bicycle only separated from the traffic and pedestrians, so the coexistence is improved, apart from that it should be suppressed the traffic in the street of the town since those streets are precious to see and by car you lose much of the landscape even in the city, and so would also decrease the pollution that there is on madrid, only that they let the vehicles of cargo and public transport enter.<br>

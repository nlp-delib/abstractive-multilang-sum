 I I says the planet does n't have the capacity to regenerate. this is okay, and it's wrong, if the house were well isolated, it wouldn't be so much needed, in my house is a room, and its roof is not well insulated, . 
<br>  some people lived in a house where they had glass windows, they were new, and they assured that the window was special for the heat, . 
<br> in the south die on the street, tries to read at over 40 degrees, and you'll notice the effects on your brain, a sign that your brain is overheated, and what for you is a lack of concentration, for a child or an elderly person is a heat stroke, my home is 43 degrees, calmly, .

if they should not be used in a country with such a warm climate as ours, almost desert, i don't know where they should be used... since we are, it propose to eliminate heating .
<br>you ask in two proposals to remove coal .
<br>do you know the coal or gas that has to be burned in power plants to produce all the megawatts hour that need to
<br>okay, : the house is a room, and its roof is not well insulated, .
<br>i think it would be more logical with its thinking. .crystal was at 55 degrees, 55, which, the first time seniors in the south die on the street, tries .
<br>we : we will have to start by asking that all the buildings are isolated in conditions, .
<br>when you buy a floor is that no one looks at the kind of isolation .
<br>air conditioning uses electrical energy, which can come from renewable sources or not. .<br>

 doesn't I don't wants you to reach old people on this planet.our way of life is not sustainable, we are so fast degrading, generating garbage, that the planet does not have the capacity to regenerate. this is okay, and it's wrong, if you know it but it has consequences for health, even hanging from the terrace door, . 
<br> crystal was at 55 degrees, which, which, the first time seniors in the south die . 
<br>  the buildings with viewpoints have been fashionable, that to everyone seems very nice, but that makes that between all the cold and the heat, especially in a city like madrid, and nobody does anything, nor is it heard about it. when you buy a floor is that no one looks at the kind of isolation that has, not even in the windows .

<br>i do you ask in two proposals to remove coal boilers
<br>do you know the coal or gas that has to be burned in power plants to produce all the megawatts hour that air conditioners need to work
<br>i feel so frank . we will have to ask that all the buildings that are built are isolated in conditions and not like everything that is built
<br>but that makes that between all the cold and the heat , especially in a city like madrid, and nobody does anything, nor is it heard about it
<br>air conditioning uses electrical energy , which can come from renewable sources or not
<br>in the case of natural gas heating , these never come from natural gas

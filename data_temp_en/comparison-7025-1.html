I don't understand how for example in Roma there are fountains everywhere and in madrid you see them and you want them to find water in summer, with the heat it makes. I would only propose that the model of source outside of those where dogs can drink in a lower overflow but have no access to reach the pipe.

 Yes. I don't believes that people use them properly. the water balloons that I have seen are usually thrown only in the warmer months, July-August and for certain hours. . 
<br>  the model of source outside of those where dogs can drink in a lower overflow but have no access to reach the pipe. it is not clear to me in the proposal whether you refer to sources of drinking water .

 a sr. had a thermometer of the water type, and came out, and there even with air conditioning, and in my house is a room, and its roof is not well insulated, and living at more than 40 degrees......., it is hell, I don't know it but it has consequences for health, even hanging towels from the terrace door, alters sleep, disturbs stress,
<br> a greeting. This doesn't work, whoever's got the money will keep buying it, and on top of it throwing the heat to which one can't pay. air conditioning makes the city's average temperature in summer rise 2 degrees. closing blinds, creating air currents (where you can) you can manage to lower the temperature. and you can move the air through fans. air conditioners make the

 I I says the planet does n't have the capacity to regenerate. this is okay, and it's wrong, if the house were well isolated, it wouldn't be so much needed, in my house is a room, and its roof is not well insulated, . 
<br>  some people lived in a house where they had glass windows, they were new, and they assured that the window was special for the heat, . 
<br> in the south die on the street, tries to read at over 40 degrees, and you'll notice the effects on your brain, a sign that your brain is overheated, and what for you is a lack of concentration, for a child or an elderly person is a heat stroke, my home is 43 degrees, calmly, .

I see that you ask in two proposals to remove coal boilers. Do you know the coal or gas that has to be burned in power plants to produce all the megawatts hour that air conditioners need to work? or do you know spent fuel (used uranium) that is generated in nuclear plants to make those megawattes? is it not better a fan of 300 w to a device of 3000 w?our way of life is not sustainable, it is not renewable. we are so fast degrading, generating garbage, that the planet does not have the capacity to regenerate.
<br>My home is 43 degrees, calmly, and knowing that every year it is heat stroke I put it at 26 degrees, is my way of taking care of my family. TV showed how that crystal was at 55 degrees, 55, which, I don't know if it's an old man's death, isn't the first time seniors in the south die on the street.

if they should not be used in a country with such a warm climate as ours, almost desert
<br>i do you ask in two proposals to remove coal boilers
<br>do you know the coal or gas that has to be burned in power plants to produce all the megawatts hour that air conditioners need to work
<br>i feel so frank . we will have to ask that all the buildings that are built are isolated in conditions and not like everything that is built
<br>but that makes that between all the cold and the heat , especially in a city like madrid, and nobody does anything, nor is it heard about it
<br>air conditioning uses electrical energy , which can come from renewable sources or not
<br>in the case of natural gas heating , these never come from natural gas

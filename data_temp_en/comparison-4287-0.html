 the week. I can record 365 days of the year to different municipalities committing violations . 
<br>  the regulation I would like to boast and venture that they know it.. no more bikes running through the sidewalks. bicycles, as they do not have a motor or occupy the same as a car or a motorcycle, perhaps they should have a different regulation than motor vehicles.On . 
<br> I neighbours. Many other car drivers do not respect rules of traffic (non-signal . 
<br>  we have not created a police aimed at chasing them. when a cyclist fails to comply with a normal traffic code, an administrative penalty can be imposed on him as well . 
<br>  the bikes can never go to 30 km/h or 50km/hr, of course to more than 50 kills a cyclist as in the past.That is no excuse for cyclists to be a danger to pedestrians, pedestrians . 
<br> I don't , a car, I , is a constant aggression, motorcycles interrupting the passage, groups along the great road in those two-wheeled armatosts, . 
<br>  it is as if the pedestrians had to ask permission to walk on the sidewalks. the worst is that it goes slower and so long as there is no bike lane, . 
<br>  in madrid today happens in almost all its streets.On the other hand I do not see how many people are complaining here walking like crazy bikes .

<br>i believe that with good intention the two can live together . i drive a bike , but also a car and a motorcycle
<br>i do not want to risk my life , nor go out on the road . i do n't want to kill my life '
<br>i believe it is because they know they are n't going to sanction them
<br>if they do n't comply with the rule , it 's because they knew they are not going to sanct them
<br>i 'm sick of bikes being put on sidewalks because madrid is n't prepared for it or his people

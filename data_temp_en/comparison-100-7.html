I have created one specifically for graffiti throughout the city, please support it. reduce the number of decibels allowed so that dogs can be free and pee-pee. I'm voting for my proposal for the washroom cleaning. It's a global problem about unchecked paints. Please vote.
<br>I support cleaning, but I like graffiti, I don't see anything unhygienic about it. Neighbors by a meter in the area of the streets the yebens, shrimp and valmojado. more than fines that they won't be able to pay would make them perform community cleaning services.
<br>I would pay 10 per month for that pet that I care for and gives me affection without doubt. You have to take care of all neighborhoods equally, as well as vallecas is being taken by drug addicts and camels. Please support my proposal! and spread to the rest of the neighborhoods.
<br>The cleaning contracts were armored in the previous legislature, and, even if they want to terminate such contracts due to clear non-compliance, it cannot be. In order to prevent something like this from happening again (government who governs), I encourage you to support the following proposal: contracts without possibility of shielding and not beyond the legislature.

no to noises. reduce the number of decibels allowed so that dogs can be free and pee-can voted. . thank you for your proposal
<br>among all we will succeed in supporting this proposal and similar! other debates:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
<br>it is as important as the safety of a city or health for people
<br>if we have insanity in a city we run a lot of risk in all aspects
<br>the points to deal with about cleaning are quite interesting
<br>there is no need to make exaggerated investments
<br>we should propose to the city council some kind of means of awareness of the neighbors of each neighborhood so that we feel involved in maintaining those improvements that we demand
<br>i would pay 10 per month for that pet that i care for and gives me affection without doubt .
<br>i leave my vote in case it helps . scraffitti should be distinguish . areas should be created so that they can make gtaffittis and the rest should be fined for doing so so
<br>i do n't like these little girls at your house on your portal and on your car . but enough of having madrid i messed up for these little girl , not of course not
<br>the fault of the current situation of dirt in madrid is the inheritance received
<br>it is a subject with the sub-contracts with which the contracts can be terminated
<br>i urge you to support the following proposal: contracts without possibility of shielding and not beyond the legislature

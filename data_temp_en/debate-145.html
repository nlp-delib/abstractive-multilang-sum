- fully agree. we must help all the non-profit associations registered in the city and which collect in their founding statutes objectives related to sustainability and respect for the environment, the integration of groups at risk of exclusion, equality, dissemination of culture, etc. alcobendas has a house of associations, with common spaces for the use of the associations, where they can meet and carry out activities, as well as a mailbox where to house their mail. it is something that works and to imitate. we should disseminate this proposal among all the many associations of madrid and their associates, so that it goes up in support.thanks for the initiative!.
<br>- Great initiative. Thank you very much!.
<br>- thanks for the support. it would be interesting that from the entities themselves we promote the support of this initiative, encouraging and teaching our partners, supporters, participants, etc. in the use of this tool offered by the city council. I propose that you make the web public among all of them, so that we can gradually get closer to the objective that this and other proposals can reach full or at least be taken into account. good hunting.

<br>- very much in favour of this proposal, since many associations, such as in which I participate, do not have a space to meet or be able to work on contents to realize. I hope that it will come forward, and that soon, each district, or those who request it, will have these spaces.
<br>- I think it's a great idea. Just like in vegetables there are many more neighborhoods and districts where undervalued municipal spaces and non-profit associations that juggle to get to pay the rent. I hope this initiative has a lot to go..
<br>- fully agree, let us centralize the proposal:

It has already been tried in other countries and only the management of all this costs more than the possible benefit to obtain. The fundamental reason why it is not mandatory for cyclists to take liability insurance, it is simply because they do not represent a sufficient risk. that is not compulsory insurance, does not imply that cyclists, like all of us, do not have civil liability.
<br>It is the same problem as that of a few years ago the mopeds. I do not understand that 3 per year are a problem. I think like you that the bike lane must extend and protect. It is mandatory that dogs wear chip and more than recommended for their owner who has insurance (in some breeds it is obligatory)
<br>I would not like someone tomorrow to have a serious problem, this is like the "preferents". there were people who warned about the problem but few noticed. the best is enemy of the good, but we try to make good rules that include the protection of cyclists. being considered a vehicle when travelling by public road has some drawbacks but a thousand advantages.
<br>I almost got killed when I left my house at 7.30 in the morning. I spent one on a bike at full speed when I went to Adelaan to get out and it was a matter of a second not to end up in the hospital. every day you go out on the street now with the stress of not coming a bike from behind. They go at all speed through the sidewalks and they care a pepper if they overwhelm you or not.

 unpractical.It has been tried in other countries and only the management of all costs more than the possible benefit to obtain.And if it is because you can sanction them, that is not a problem, you can be perfectly sanctioned and you can demand compliance with the regulations as everyone else..but demanding the registration of bicycles is a bit crazy. .

<br> cycling lanes in my opinion should be reserved exclusively for cyclists. the opposite (like that invention of putting a pedestrian line in the bike lane itself, . 
<br>  there is only one bicycle in Spain. the day the compensations are fired believe me that for many having spent euros on the insurance will be worth it: no, am not inventing anything. in some Spanish municipalities the tax is a fact: .

<br>  I is a having "power" that there is q know how to use and most of the q cycling on the sidewalks are lacking education .

your approach is not uncanny , but it has already been tried in other countries and only the management of all this costs more than the possible benefit to obtain
<br>you can be perfectly sanctioned and you can demand compliance with the regulations as everyone else
<br>the fundamental reason why it is not mandatory for cyclists to take liability insurance is simply because they do not represent a sufficient risk
<br>it is mandatory that dogs wear chip and more than recommended for their owner who has insurance
<br>the majority of people have the insurance that covers that kind of thing (gypsum, shopping cart) ) living in a house and having the insurance of it they usually cover this type of thing
<br>in madrid it is true and in that i give you all the reason that cyclists do not yet represent a real danger
<br>in some spanish municipalities the registration and the tax is a fact
<br>many of them have already ruled it out
<br>the best is enemy of the good , but we try to make good rules that include the protection of cyclists
<br>i almost got killed when i left my house at 7.30 in the morning
<br>i spent one on a bike at full speed when i went to adelaan to get out and it was a matter of a second not to end up in the hospital
<br>my work partner has been eight months off because she was hit by a bike
<br>with all the fuss of taking her to the hospital the cyclist has vanished

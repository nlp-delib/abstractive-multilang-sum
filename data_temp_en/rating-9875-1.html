- It's legal to make graffiti, isn't it? Because the proposal is absurd, with all the respect of the world.
<br>- legal? no. it's not legal. the moment you modify an alien property without permission, to degrade it or change its state, is not lawful. if the graffiti you do it with permission of the owner, total legal. if you graffiti in public area not suitable for it, illegal. whether you graffiti a house, a business, a wall that is part of a public space, illegal... if you do so with permission, legal. I don't know if it'll be clear to you.
<br>- meridian clarity. But that's not what you propose. Or I misunderstand it or it's miswritten. I agree with you in your comment.
<br>- the problem is that for every banksy there are five million bastards who piss us off the city with their marranades and if we encourage them much worse. I like to see my city clean, however much you miss it. if you want to paint do it at home.
<br>- do not worry about this person, will criticize (as can be seen in his profile) any proposal that makes or is sponsored by me, but is grateful for the defense of the proposal.
<br>- Why does that personal attack make anyone who doesn't agree with you? is that you can't disagree or what?.
<br>- personal attack is tying up the city where we all live and having to pay a dollar of our taxes to clean it up.
<br>- and why not on the portal to their homes?
<br>- it's not to tie. You have to separate art from what it isn't, nothing else.
<br>- in everyone's, if it's art!<br>

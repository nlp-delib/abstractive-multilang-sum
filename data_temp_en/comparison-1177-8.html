it 's very true, in my daughter's school that is paid in cooperative and the truth that works great, and above all children learn to share and care for class .
<br>what should inescapably be done is to reuse textbooks, and that all schools use the same. textbooks, .
<br>if they go with chips and very few books so this should do in many .
<br>the 'elephant in the room' are the editorials and their practices. and their practices. are practices. and practices. 'the : the educational authorities should create and make available to the educational community a bank of digital and printable resources .
<br>another : it 's true that a more sustainable material, within the reach of all budgets, and books that they change every single thing) seems more appropriate
<br>he says it would have to pay its amortization to acquire new books of updated editions .
<br>it should be like everything else, depending on income, but for that there are also scholarships... .it is being done to learn and less to change editorials every two .
<br>!, besides there are places to take away...i do not think it will touch .
<br>that someone was proposing
<br>i support this request, we have to end the marketing of children's .
<br>this, is a brilliant idea, and in fact i could create a proposal on this, but i am not a specialist in training and didactics .<br>

 to the editorials who live from a prehistoric model, not water. a greeting. what should inescapably be done is to reuse textbooks, and that all schools cover the same (recycled paper, color / bn, etc.). what makes the most sense is to develop/suffraise independently (i.e. without bias) an editorial line of school books.
<br> an example, the editorial mafias. if you can and don't need data, the question is do you want to invest in bulls or education? to set an example. I agree with you, that publishing is a business in my opinion excessive. I think the educational authorities should create and make available to the educational community a bank of digital and printable resources that would cover the pedagogical contents
<br> I will not touch you!!, besides there are many places to take away...I do not have children, but I support this request, we have to end the marketing of children's education, even if you don't have children.. without them and a good future you won't charge pensions!!! I do not think it will touch you.. I think it is a brilliant idea,

Free books should be extended to all types of centres covered by public centres. It is absurd to shift the (current) cost of parents' textbooks to the city hall. what is the point of subsidizing the bad practice of publishers? all content should be licensed as cc by-sa, and accept the participation of independent experts.
<br>In my opinion, books should belong to schools, and not to students. At the end of the course, all books should be returned in perfect condition. I think the same should be done with textbooks and library books: they are taken, used, and left as they are. I find it difficult that with the taxes that we pay public schools can take charge of that expense.
<br>I don't have children, but I support this request, we have to end the marketing of children's education. It is not necessary to use text books as it is being done to learn and less to change editorials every two years. Everyone who pays taxes should be entitled to free books and should not discriminate if you study in a public or private school.

<br>as a teacher and mother i very much agree with you that publishing is a business in my opinion excessive
<br>i think that the educational authorities should create and make available to the educational community a bank of digital and or printable resources that would cover the pedagogical contents established by the law
<br>i find it difficult that with the taxes that we pay public schools can take charge of that expense
<br>it turns out that investing in education is everyone 's business
<br>it is not necessary to use text books as it is being done to learn and less to change editorials every two years
<br>anyone who pays taxes should be entitled to free books and should not discriminate if you study in a public or private school

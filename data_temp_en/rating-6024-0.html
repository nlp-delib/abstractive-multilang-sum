- the first to say that I am in favour of these containers again, but there are a lot of organizations that will pick up the enchanted clothes. the previous containers withdrew because the company, it seems that it took advantage of the donated clothes for its own benefit and did not fulfill its original purpose. sure that in the parish of each neighborhood will be happy to pick it up.
<br>- apart from the importance of what is done with these clothes, it can be provided to those institutions/ongs/parochies that there are containers for people to deposit the clothes. in addition, this makes it visible and guarantees that more people make donations (if it is really necessary, of course, I do not know the data about it).
<br>- it would be good if this service were provided, and the containers depended on some unprofitable NGO and were detached from religious organizations.
<br>- What is wrong with the management of a religious organization? currently in madrid hundreds of clothes are managed by religious organizations, and so far they have not bitten anyone who has gone to get clothes;)
<br>- voted. In rent we have this problem with the dirt and lewdness of the neighborhood, please vote:
<br>- with private or public companies. the private would understand it as a business (maybe it was interesting though I'm not clear).
<br>- better to take the clothes to some ong, where they'll really give it to the people who need it and not trade the mafia with this.
<br>- the worn clothes are left over in many of the wardrobes of all Spain. there is a misconception of what to do with it. as with the packaging that you have used, or with the periodical that has already stopped reading, or the glass bottle that has consumed your liquid, the e.g. says "the worn clothes is a residue" and must be managed by professionals. the correct management does not mean to destroy or transform, it can also be reused as is the case with the used pneumatics that are still in use. it is not necessary to mask with ong's or charity the proper management. it takes many containers but it does not need to be seen as a donation and so I remain calm, but as the management of my residue by practitioners. in Spain it is managed only 18% of all the used clothes that are produced, which means that there is still a lot of travel to do things properly and not fill the dumps of the textiles that all i get them. asirtex veil for transparent sustainability.
<br>- there are containers (particular) that collect the clothes supposedly for people in need, but then they dedicate themselves to reselling it. a whole business. this if it is in the hands of the city council would not happen. you should collect the broken and useless clothes to recycle it and that it does not have to end in the garbage. and the clothes that is in good condition and that for different reasons some people must get rid of it and do not know who to give it to the town council should be able to give to organizations without profit that would give them to people who need them.
<br>- I agree, as long as you do not mask behind an NGO that is not, if it were something clear, transparent, the use given to it, many people that we have not previously made use of those containers, we would also do so. we must make a filter of the clothes that can be worth or can be sold second-hand for solidarity or community purposes and that is no longer worth and is a residue that you can recycle.<br>

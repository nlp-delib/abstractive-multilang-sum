<br> the association of neighbors of center and the rest do not agree with the subject of pedestrianization because in doing so the locals and the bars would request to put more terraces in the streets that we already have when we have the necessary width to apply for the license. with the prevention of the entry into the area to the non-residents with their cars, problems of noise, pollution, parking for the residents and quality of life in

<br> a thousand problems. to pedestrianize nothing. that those who so much cry for pedestrianization, it is because they have not pedestrianized their neighborhood and have not been able to check the supposed "advantages" such as: that nobody wants to give you a package that you receive by mail and you have to fold at their schedules (if you can), that the bars fill the street with chairs and tables,
<br> you can insult me again, because I don't want to prioritize your proposals with comments. do you not have enough examples of pedestrian streets in madrid that in your day sold it as a benefit to the Madridns?Do you not know that invasion and appropriation dr the street is a desire of cadi all the hoteliers?Did you ignore that pedestrianizing the street, under the
<br>. It is not so difficult... it only takes will. a greeting and luck.. I am from the hostelry and I'm from the Latina. I support this motion including all the neighborhoods of the historic madrid. any European city that is valued have regulated traffic in the historical central area in a much more efficient and effective way than here. but of course, this is a personal opinion without importance.
<br> apr areas, seem to me completely insufficient. I live in the neighborhood letters and this is horrific. the cars that circulate through them, that are not few, go at all speed, painting you all day and giving you scars of death. and distribution, under strict schedule, with a maximum duration of 5 hours and weekends prohibited. if you have that privilege, I also want it. I support this

5 cities around the world that want to stop using cars the first: madrid. The city would improve a great pedestrian path with space for banks, bicycles and green areas that project shade. There are examples of cities that have improved a lot as a plague where it is now a pleasure to walk.
<br>Neighbors of Madrid have been fighting for pedestrianization of central area for years. Proposal created to which you can vote as to this one: thank you. apr for the whole central zone of madrid is absolutely necessary. We would have to polish the proposal, but I think it is necessary to decongest the center ofmadrid.
<br>I hope that traffic will soon be restricted in the madrid centre, so that the clams unable to give up the car have to catch public transport by nose. The government team that casts itself against the drivers loses all the elections because they are an immense majority. The best of all is that some of those who don't want to leave the car threw pests out of the tobacco.
<br>I am against any pedestrianization, while there are caradura hoteliers in this city... that seem to exist many years. I do not like cars, but I prefer them before all that. If you encourage or give priority to electric cars throughout the city, it will be a very effective measure against pollution and will not affect the freedom of movement.
<br>Do you not know that invasion and appropriation of the street is a desire of cadi all the hoteliers? Did you ignore that pedestrianizing the street, under the pretext of improving life to all, is a meta excuse and a commercial strategy to end up taking hold of it and regret leaving a minimum space to the travellers? Are you living on Tuesday not to see what happens in front of your noses year after year?
<br>I think it's smarter to set up the apr throughout the center, allows residents and distributors access and decongests the center for greater pedestrian enjoyment. Any European city that is valued have regulated traffic in the historical central area in a much more efficient and effective way than here. I am outraged that there is a whole full sidewalk of places reserved for the nunciature and the church of San Miguel in the street sacrament.
<br>We're more than fed up with that public space, which is of all (my also) being permanently occupied by tables chairs, furniture and armatosts. How about if I make a parcel in the middle of the street, the fence and I put a social hall for my friends? if you have that privilege, I also want it. if I don't generate enough income without disturbing and invading others, think about it.

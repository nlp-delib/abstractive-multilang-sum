- it is very true, in my daughter's school that is public, from 3-6 years all class material is paid in cooperative and the truth that works great, and above all children learn to share and care for class material. from 6 nose if they go with chips and very few books so this should do in many schools. a greeting.
<br>- what should inescapably be done is to reuse textbooks, and that all schools use the same.
<br>Free books should be extended to all types of centres covered by public centres.
<br>- it is absurd to shift the (current) cost of parents' textbooks to the city hall. the 'elephant in the room' are the editorials and their practices. what is the point of subsidizing the bad practice of publishers? what makes the most sense is to develop/suffraise independently (i.e. without bias) an editorial line of school books. all content should be licensed as cc by-sa, and accept the participation of independent experts, professionals in education and teaching (wiki). then the town hall, private companies or the centers themselves can dedicate themselves to printing such books in the format that interests them most (recycled paper, color / bn, etc.).
<br>- I'm not sure if you've read my comment. I've never objected to paying for school material. I have opposed to paying with public money for books that cost 200% (invented number) more than they are worth.Sometimes subsidies hide the basic problem, in this case: books don't cost what they're worth.
<br>- and on the way, the editorial x can be allowed to continue increasing the price of your books, why total, pays the city council. let's be realistic, how much 10 experts (9 subjects + 1 pedagogue) full-time writing a school book base? how much it costs to print these materials in a copyshop? sure the idea is not instantaneous. it seems reasonable to subsidize the books until the ones I propose were ready. but to the editorials who live from a prehistoric model, not water.
<br>- as a teacher and mother I very much agree with you, that publishing is a business in my opinion excessive. I think that the educational authorities should create and make available to the educational community a bank of digital and or printable resources that would cover the pedagogical contents established by the law so that they could be used autonomously by each teacher and at the same time facilitate the creation and distribution of edited materials that would be reused in successive courses.
<br>- I think it should be like everything else, depending on income, but for that there are also scholarships... I enjoyed them for a good part of my teens and then in college. Another separate debate is what is behind the publishing business... but it is true that a more sustainable material, within the reach of all budgets, and books that last longer (not that they change every single thing) seems more appropriate to me.
<br>- in my opinion, books should belong to schools, and not to students. At the end of the course, all books should be returned in perfect condition. I think the same should be done with textbooks and library books: they are taken, used, and left as they are..
<br>- personally, I find it difficult that with the taxes that we pay public schools can take charge of that expense. I have seen in some comment that you could make some kind of cooperative, which seems to me a very interesting idea. although it is essential that the books do not change from one year to another. what less than 4 years with the same books?? being realistic, the contents cannot vary so much.
<br>- I agree with the line of argument of re-using the books. in any case it would not be totally free since it would have to pay its amortization to acquire new books of updated editions or to go replacing the deteriorated regarding the gratuitousness of the books I think the concept is a fallacy, the only thing that would happen is that the cost would be paid in terms of taxes instead of in the bookstore, but at the end of anyway our money would end up in the hands of the editorials.
<br>- by removing the disqualifications of both I agree, all that is done in education is little, beginning by responding with education.
<br>- Good idea.
<br>- another theme, the editorial mafias.
<br>- if you can and don't need data, the question is do you want to invest in bulls or education? to set an example.
<br>- it turns out that investing in education is everyone's business, even if you don't have children.. without them and a good future you won't charge pensions!!, besides there are many places to take away...I do not think it will touch you.
<br>- seems more viable the rental system that someone was proposing here.
<br>- I don't have children, but I support this request, we have to end the marketing of children's education.
<br>- it is not necessary to use text books as it is being done to learn and less to change editorials every two years.
<br>- everyone who pays taxes should be entitled to free books and should not discriminate if you study in a public or private school.
<br>- of course and then there will come a time when those who have money are those who do not pay a service for their payroll and those with a higher payroll just pay and receive nothing.or gratuity for everyone or tax relief provided to their rents, for those who pay the books. the redistribution of income consists in that, not in that everything is free but in the reallocation of wealth.
<br>- in my opinion, books do not encourage an innovative and motivating methodology, in addition to the cost involved, should disappear and teachers should design attractive materials for students.
<br>- totally agree.
<br>- not only books, but also other technical and human means necessary to create a dignified and progressive education, if we want change..
<br>- I think it is a brilliant idea, and in fact I could create a proposal on this, but I am not a specialist in training and didactics and it is not possible if I could defend this position well, before the attacks, from the lackeys of the publishers, I will probably receive it, but if I encourage you to believe that proposal.In that case, do not forget to tell me to add it to the corresponding lists and to make it public.
<br>- I would like to invite you to notify all your supporters by notification so that they visit the proposal that proposals over 100 can not be deleted each year with more than 100 support. (40 support) to prevent something like this (arbitrary murder of proposals), from happening again or from happening to the next proposals that are in the attic.
<br>- I'll answer you so that I don't miss this incredible proposal, if anyone has seen any similar ones please let me know.<br>

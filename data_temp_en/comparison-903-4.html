 public transport is not encouraged outside peak hours? in London, it was much cheaper to take out a simple ticket to use between 09.30 and 4.30 than for the rest of the day. . 
<br>  in the case of having minors they might have a special price in their transport bonus up to a certain age, for example up to 16 years that they would pay half the cost of the fertilizers (6,10 . 
<br> the "extraordinary" is only available 6 months after they have lost the right to the usual unemployment benefit. . 
<br>  it is not the right term. Do not fool us the president of the madrid community with that patch and include all the unemployed. a card like the oyster of London . 
<br>  the second part (which only counts the days actually used), I think it is new and therefore the support and step to include both in the list .

the use of public transport is not encouraged outside peak .
<br>they could also lower the price of the metro bonus .
<br>the bus drivers were not so abrupt, and the subway didn't smell .
<br>for example, in london, it was much cheaper .
<br>what you're commenting on in your proposal, is what has londons with a card. .the unemployed is exclusively for those who are receiving a benefit from the so-called "extraordinary" which is only available 6 months .
<br>do not fool us the president of the madrid community with that patch and include all the unemployed. unemployed. .

I think very good ideas, but I also propose a cheaper metro bus for children and young people. Those who have two or more children we spend a pasta every time we use the metro or bus (cheap rooms the private car and the ticket of the hour) more info about my proposal in twitter @metrobusjovenya.
<br>It is important to add that what has just been proposed is exclusively for those who are receiving a benefit from the so-called "extraordinary" which is only available 6 months after they have lost the right to the usual benefit. Do not fool us the president of the madrid community with that patch and include all the other proposals.

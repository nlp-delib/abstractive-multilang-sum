 if you speak for the whatapp, that when you are talking to someone, or infinity of things more, it distracts a lot more, so much so that on many occasions . 
<br>  a cyclist is more distracted or any qualifier you want to put us on, it's not true, because it goes a thousand times more pending than a pedestrian . 
<br> I have n't talked about distracted, a pedestrian on the sidewalk can go as distracted as he wants if he hits someone is at 5 km/h . 
<br>  the new city council gives us, but to use it correctly we have to take into account 2 things/rules/standards that are pure logic and coherence:1-do not repeat proposals please, . 
<br> the mobility ordinance fails to comply with the greater but all the rules, like not stopping in groups to speak, run, jump or do any kind of act . 
<br>  the biggest offender is not the cyclist; only for a few who do the goat you already get us all, when we do not even half of the nonsense . 
<br> the cyclists that you comment, are foreigners who use the electric bicycles of the madrid community, or people who wear walking bikes or have been riding on it for a very short time, have to go on the road . 
<br>  I am also a favourer of coexistence and respect to which you do not feel the same, but the principle of an agreement is that they are not discriminated positively in terms of traffic rules. I . 
<br> madrid is a city for bicycles, for its orography and influx of citizens . 
<br>  it is removed a lane to change it by bicycle only separated from the traffic and pedestrians, so the coexistence is improved, apart from that it should be suppressed the traffic in the street of the town since those streets are precious to see and by car you lose much of the landscape .

I'm sorry, I use the bike lane, and if there's no bike lane I'll use the road, but you're the ones who don't respect it, because you invade the bicycle lane when you can't walk through it. You're wearing a hat and a hat, and you really don't have to generalize.
<br>In other countries the bike lane is not on the sidewalk, but on the road. The helmet is not mandatory in madrid, except for those under 16 years of age. If it is mandatory at night, it doesn't make sense not to wear them. The idea is not bad but proposed in another way would be better.
<br>The biggest offender is not the cyclist; only for a few who do the goat. In general, I repeat that I am not talking about you in particular but about what I see day by day, do not comply with the rules. I think the truth, especially for children, seems to me to be in favor of banning running on the streets.
<br>I must understand that the bike is an alternative to the car, motorcycle, or public transport. True, motorcycles reach higher speeds than bicycles, and therefore the risk of falling with injury/death increases. bicycles do not reach speeds as high as cars or motorcycles, so the possibility of injury in the event of an accident is less. this relationship is one that allows not to use the helmet to cyclists, provided that the basic traffic rules are met.
<br>The vast majority of accidents suffered by cyclists, are a consequence of the behaviors of other cars. I am also in favour of coexistence, but it is logical and reasonable also that there are certain things that are not logical. I honestly do not think that madrid is a city for bicycles, for its orography and influx of citizens.

 a cyclist is more distracted or any qualifier you want to put us on, it's not true, because there are people walking that is much more distracted, . 
<br>  if you're talking for the mobile, that you're see as much as I'm the one who doesn't get properly dressed, or uses them to crucify like a pedestrian and continue, or is jamming traffic or being a potential danger to the number of elderly and adults . 
<br> a pedestrian can cause an accident or hurt?? of course yes, but minor and is "the weakest" as he loves to say to the cyclist collective . 
<br>  the new city council gives us, to use it correctly we have to take into account 2 things/rules/standards that are pure logic and coherence:1-do not repeat proposals . 
<br> ruben navarrette : the biggest offender is not the cyclist; only for a few who do the goat you already get us all, . 
<br>  he says there 's a group of people talking about their life and in terms of clothes the helmet as another user says, it is mandatory . 
<br>  he says it 's not correct the ordinance that regulates things, . 
<br> cars, are foreigners who use the electric bicycles of the madrid community, or people who wear walking bikes or have been riding on it for a very short time, . 
<br>  if you have to wear special clothes, , you can also make it impossible for a child to drive a car, a motorcycle, if there is a minimum age for travelling with most vehicles, like not doing so . 
<br>  the principle of an agreement is that they are not positively in terms of traffic rules. . 
<br> I correct" : there is little respect for the bike by many of the behaviors of other cars. . 
<br>  right. : a car, and less driven by a 5-year-old child, can tell you that a woman in the palm of majorca is less at risk than a 3or 5 year-old with a bike . 
<br>  she says madrid is a city for bicycles, and influx of citizens on its streets, .

first we would have to fine all those who use bicycles by failing to comply with the traffic code
<br>i 'm sorry, i use the bike lanekkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
<br>i have not talked about distracted , a pedestrian on the sidewalk can go as distracted as he wants if he hits someone is at 5 km/h and with the body not with a metal instrument like a bike and at a higher speed
<br>that a pedestrian can cause an accident or hurt , but minor and is " the weakest " as he loves to say to the cyclist collective when they defend themselves from the drivers
<br>the greater offender the cyclist, you will tell me why
<br>when the pedestrian according to the mobility ordinance fails to comply with the greater but all the rules
<br>like not stopping in groups to speak, run, jump or do any kind of act that bother the many users of the road
<br>the cyclists that you comment, are foreigners who use the electric bicycles of the madrid community
<br>those if i agree with you are the least to follow the rules of traffic
<br>but in the case of the road bicycles or mountain bikes , like this one mine
<br>the vast majority of accidents suffered by cyclists are a result of the behaviors of other cars
<br>i honestly do not think that madrid is a city for bicycles
<br>but as today is what is "politically correct " and what politicians believe that gives votes

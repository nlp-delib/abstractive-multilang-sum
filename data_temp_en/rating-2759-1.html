- it is a very sensible proposal but, as a Madrid cyclist, I must say that it seems to me that the solution is to gain space to the car, not to the pedestrian. I would be more in favour of lane-bikes on the road, perhaps protected to ensure that the cars do not invade it, and at a certain distance from the parked cars (because of the danger of opening a door).On the other hand, I encourage you to lose the fear to circulate along the road. it seems very dangerous, but once you get used to it it is not so much. the keys are circular through the center of the car so that they do not pass by spraying and have to use the adjacent lane if they want to advance you, look for quiet streets (like the streets of a single lane for a sense, in which a bike can go at more speed than the car can, because of space) and always respect the rules of traffic.if you want to try, throw a bug on the page or its twitter @enbicipormad. to me it helped me a lot.
<br>- I apologize for that "beast"... I don't know what happened to me.
<br>- I do not see it sensible, is to move the fear of the cyclist by the car, to the pedestrian by the bicycle. precisely where you indicate, the risks of the bicycle lanes are shown, and even greater of the bike sidewalk. I like your encouragement to use the road, I also encourage everyone since it is the best way to be safer. the more we are safer it will be.
<br>- we must not rule out anything. although in principle the circulation of bicycles must be on the road, exceptionally the sidewalk could be used in certain cases such as, e.g., the movement of minors or adults accompanying them. and always, subject to the respect and priority of the pedestrian..
<br>- very in line with your neighbor's ideas. The sidewalks for pedestrians and roads better share them with cars (with or without separation). I have lost the fear of travelling along the road, and I make myself respect enough as I respect the basic rules of circulation.
<br>- I mean wide sidewalks and always with priority for the pedestrian. what I prefer are actually exclusively bike lanes, and it would be in places where these lanes do not exist. the road is not an option for me or for many like me, I have seen several cyclists hit on madrid and, although they do not come out in the newspapers, one of them with a dead man on the road, on the pontoon ride I think it was, I saw it from the bus.
<br>- my total agreement with orgmaestro that says "I don't see it sensible, is to move the fear of the cyclist by the car, to the pedestrian by the bicycle. precisely where you indicate, the risks of the bicycle lanes are shown, and even greater of the bike sidewalk. I like your encouragement to use the road, I also encourage everyone since it is the best way to be safer. the more we are safer it will be" by God think of the elderly and how they are scared when they meet a vehicle (and the bike is) by the sidewalk.
<br>- I support the proposal and launch this supplementary. a proposal for a real regulation of light electric vehicles, which are already on the market and which are currently, in madrid, in limbo, when in other cities and countries they are a truly effective, ecological and sustainable reality.
<br>- I think the problem is that cyclists in many cases believe that they are the kings of circulation and do not respect the rules or traffic and pedestrians at all, I think that the minimum width so that they can circulate bicycles on the sidewalks is 3 meters and always to the meter and half of the facades to avoid (what I have seen) taking forward the people who leave the portals. I therefore think that if a cyclist wants to go on the pavement he has to be dismantled from his corcel as a pedestrian and if he wants to move faster to the road. the bicycle lane (as long as it can be the solution).
<br>- I support your proposal and ask for your support for another who asks for a safe bike lane network for all madrid. We are already more than 3,000 supporters!! thank you and a greeting.<br>

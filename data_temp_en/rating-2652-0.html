- it's not a bad idea but how to do it? you'd have to put special trucks that pick up garbage on the portals and take them to the subway. you would have to make special (vertical) accesses on the subway for garbage containers, and they would be mounted directly on special trains or wagons, and then in destination the same thing, a special exit. and that counting that the wagons are airtight completely and discard the variable of the problem related to smells and hygiene since the subway is a service for people used by millions of people.but I didn't read it long ago that a garbage collection system had been designed by electric mini-cars that silently picked up trash on the gateways and carried it to larger trucks that were waiting for while many of these mini-vehicles of garbage were filling them, then the garbage was taken away and the big truck was replaced by another, or made a route. (The big truck should be electric too).
<br>- maybe the big truck could be replaced by the metro car system, depending on the city of the type of metro etc.. equal if...
<br>- the idea could be carried out in phases. the first would be to promote the concept near the subway mouths with elevators. it would only open up to put the garbage containers near those entrances. so that both the neighbors and the operators can empty their waste in the containers. other subway operators could lower the cubes at night and wait for the car enabled to pass to transport the garbage cubes..
<br>- There would be.
<br>- support and supplementary proposal
<br>- the best thing would be that it was an automatic system, of lowering the containers from the surface to the car: if you look at the trash bins on the streets and in the garbage bins are surrounded by plastics and bottles and other garbage that people don't fit in because they don' t want to or because it doesn't work, and that would happen with the system you're talking about, that would be a huge hygiene problem for closed installations like the subway where air is ventilated by ducts that give to the surface etc. it would be better than when entering the meter in their infrastructure the garbage containers were sealed before, hermetic, for hygiene and safety for people, because the main activity of the subway is the transport of passengers by mass).
<br>- in fact that problem would not have to happen, since the problem of containers is that they are collected with little assiduousness. if the containers are lowered (empty) daily, a priori it does not have because they accumulate garbage around. moreover in principle the collection of garbage would be made in night hours with what the users of the metro and the containers would not cross (maybe cardboards, batteries, bulbs, or other things that do not smell, if you could pick up in daytime).Your comment has given me a new idea: you could give a bag of garbage, of a "small" size with large wings, so that they serve to make the knot, that it would serve to throw the garbage in the containers of the subway. the bags would be paid with advertising. in this way we ensure that the problems of health are a little more controlled..
<br>- Like this?
<br>- There are no women on this website or what?
<br>- if. the idea is that:1) the bags are small enough for the daily garbage and so do not store more than necessary at home2) have no cost to the user3) close in a more efficient way than a shopping bag.
<br>- Who assures me you're not one?
<br>Do you have a women's detector?
<br>- My mother... I've kept your proposal.
<br>- because it has to be recognized that it is very ingenious, has implementation problems, practical, but a very large and very widespread city (which occupies a lot of space) and with a good network of equal metro could take it into account very seriously....
<br>- I hadn't thought about it seriously. if it might be important for the city council to give away the garbage bags, even regardless of the proposal to use the subway network. the same thing that gives the bags to pick up dog poop should give up the others, because... people save on that, and the truth, it's a mess, it didn't fall on it. It's normal, people don't have the fault of not getting to the end of the month, and if you have to save on something because they use garbage bags whatever they have at hand... (some shops hole the bags in the bottom).
<br>- I like that you like. I believe firmly in it. I'm sure you need a detailed station-by-station study, but the concept is very beneficial.If you like it, vote it out and go to see if we get someone up to hear it. thank you very much!.
<br>I think it would leave a bad smell both in tunnels and on roads and I see it a little annoying. Not to say, that not all citizens have a subway station under their house (in many areas of Madrid, the nearest metro station is more than 500 meters away, and surely people would get pissed off if they had to go that far to throw away the garbage (not to say what it would cost to go to the stations to citizens with some kind of reduced mobility). I see more problems than solutions can provide this system.
<br>- Well, that has a solution: the garbage containers (meter bagon size) that entered the subway network would shut it down, and sealed and decontaminated hygienically on the outside...
<br>- the smells would go away with the wagon just as they now go with the truck. although not all citizens have a subway mouth near if many. consider it a complementary proposal to the current system. the people with reduced mobility we hate the current cubes (impossible to open) the glass-collected domes with the mouth so high and the spaces that occupy in the street that cut us off..
<br>- in Germany the town hall regales the yellow bags for the recycling of containers. on the municipal council there is a piece of furniture from where you can take a roll of bags per person..
<br>- in your proposal, it is taken for granted (it is not explicitly indicated but understood) that it is not a complementary system to the current one, since you say that we would end up with the bad smells on the street, we would recover public space,... I understand that people with reduced mobility hate the current cubes (you can always fight for a more welcoming city for everyone and adapt the cubes so that they can be used by all people), but if we have to make them go to a subway station to throw away the garbage, we will be demanding an effort that will overcome them. I would keep the current system, adapting it to the needs of everyone. as to the subject of the smells, surely they would remain in the tunnels, and above with the heat that it does in summer....anyone gets into the subway.
<br>- I don't think it's possible to keep the subway network without smelling like neighbor trash. If it is already hot in summer that doesn't hold, imagine sharing tunnels with wagons carrying garbage.
<br>- the truth is that at no time would you share the tunnels with wagons that carry garbage. the collection and transport of garbage would be done in the hours that the subway network was closed. your doubts are reasonable but have solution..
<br>- maybe explain it to me wrong. my proposal is complementary, since not everyone has a subway mouth nearby. as far as the smells are concerned, I don't think they remain in tunnels, as the garbage does not accumulate in tunnels in the same way as the smell of sweat (or colony) of the Madridns does not build up in tunnels;-). for the topic of heat I have no proposal.
<br>- even if they are not shared, the smell remains very safe. still, your idea is original and I would like to see more opinions about it. a neighbor greeting.
<br>- The second is fine to give bags to a few. To solve the problem would be the first.
<br>- it would be appropriate, that you modify your proposal (I think it can be edited) to add the complementary character you indicate..
<br>- the containers would have to be sealed before entering the metro, and disinfected on the outside (both in terms of sanitary and odours). I say that the idea is interesting, if the metro is not used to transport some kind of goods (of course, the construction material of the metro itself is transported along the roads, but...) but the idea could serve for other different goods, but it would be necessary to design special containers and design how to handle them, on the surface and inside the subway, and a protocol of disinfection and hygiene, so that you do not pass that of the smells, the air of the subway probably needs more ventilation.
<br>- Done!
<br>- as mentioned above, the smells would not remain the same as neither in tunnels nor in the stations remains the smell of the Madriders for the next day. a greeting!.
<br>- indeed, that is what I would like to hear. more ideas! in positive! with solutions! a greeting neighbors!.
<br>- but... thinking about all the data together. also there is something that we should change: to see... electricity is underground and goes through the basement just like water and sewer pipes etc., why not leave the metro, for what this proposal proposes, for the transport of goods and containers of garbage etc. containers of other products etc. and not of people, and we build on the surface a network of trams or trolleybuses or floating trains (of those sustained levitate with electro-magnets and that they were going to be the future) etc. for people and cars we leave them out of the city in strategic parking lots? shouldn't we change the whole concept of the transport system? why people have to move through tunnels and goods by the surface in trucks? (the only reason is the cars that occupy most of the streets).
<br>- it would never open up to me, I like it. the only thing I see against it is that the crowds of neighbors are quite far from the subway mouth (there are 300 stations (baskets of garbage) for 3 million people) and you would have to make a lot of transfers in the vans that you say the same. you can also not do a good walk every day just to throw garbage up to the metro mouth. I am sure that if you keep going around it can be a good solution. pd.- cleaning workers who are going to run out of work won't thank you very much.
<br>- I like that you like it. the idea is not to take a walk to take the garbage, if you don't take the walk to dump the garbage. even if it was a minority of people who go to the subway every morning or live close to a subway mouth, that minority we are talking about hundreds of thousands of people, saving lots of garbage trucks.cleaning workers would not be left out of work, they would be relocated to cleaning tasks. the only thing that changes them is that they no longer have to make miles of highway to empty the truck.
<br>- I haven't located the changes. In the virtues area, it is assumed that it is a substitute service.
<br>- very good observation, jajajajajjaja.
<br>I've been reading all the notes you've provided, and I still think it would be hard to execute, but I think it wouldn't be bad if you were given a look at what you're proposing.
<br>- There are, there are:-).
<br>- Thank you.
<br>- it seems to me very ingenious! congratulations! that the collection and transport of the garbage is done in the basement, you pose the subway, in wagons, etc... but we would also not have to rule out that, instead of doing it in the subway cars, -sealed or as it were to avoid odors-, to transport it through tunnels - perhaps parallel to the subway network - but with conveyor belts, independent of the metro cars, if there is a height,... in any case, when they make new neighborhoods, within the urbanistic performances, in the same way that the water, tlf, gas,... they should consider the issue of collecting and transporting the garbage,..
<br>- this proposal may be of interest:
<br>- Honestly, with this voting system on this web we don't get the 54,000 support or pussy.... it's a system that doesn't group issues, on this matter I have read 7 pages of petitions. the best thing is to try to make some medium echo.I've been fighting with this for 2 years now... and it doesn ́t matter, neither the lady bottle, nor the lady carmena nor... ines savanes... they pay attention, it is third worldist, but through their homes they don ́t spend the night collecting garbage.
<br>- I moved for change and nothing.
<br>- I would call the system revolutionary. My only concern is the cost of adaptation. better to invest in reducing waste, via sanction, to the incivic neighbors who do not fulfill their obligation to separate and throw in hermetic bags correctly in the containers of clean points mobile and fixed. the costs are more economical those of pneumatic collection than to use the metro. it is proposed to open the metro at night for travelers, if not done already, is due to a problem of citizen security.
<br>- hi, thank you for calling it revolutionary, a priori, I don't see why the cost would be more expensive than your solution of putting clean points, pq that's the same idea, but I propose to install clean points near subway mouths.I don ́t propose picking up pneumatics, if not taking advantage of the subway network to evict garbage.a saludojaime.
<br>- my proposal solves the issue, but it's not the same.
<br>- I agree, and it's a shame you don't have enough reception, but I think this website is a grain of sand that if we take care of it it can go very far..
<br>- that's what I'm asking, for example line 2, which passes through the center of town and where garbage trucks create big noise and jam problems.
<br>- thank you, I think your proposal is extremely expensive, and it only benefits the builders, besides posing a problem to the neighbors during the construction of the new pipes.As I said earlier, the subway wagons would not have to seal them, as the garbage collection is done at another time and never travelers and garbage share wagons. the smells would not remain the same as the human smells do not remain for the next day.
<br>- Thank you, I don't see the difficulty of lowering the garbage cans from the street to a platform in an elevator, putting it in a wagon at 3 in the morning, that a train from the 80s will pick them up and release them elsewhere..
<br>- Jaimegm to the #tuasks of isabans has been a crush.
<br>- maybe it's an optimist, but I don't see a chasque that a politician presents himself to respond to citizens. It's the first time that it was possible to do it and in an ideal world it happened more often, but for something it starts. I'm sure there's a better way, but today this is the best one. I am sure that it is impossible to reach the 54000 signatures (in fact I do not think or aue there are 54000 people given discharge) but this is a place where you can write, propose,... and someday maybe you have enough strength to make it really useful, but right now it is just a beginning, however frustrating it is.
<br>- Yes and no... care not all are the same... but now madrid there are people who want to fight and politicians. ines savanes is political.
<br>- encourage and plant it for participatory budgets.
<br>- we better do it by plane, it's cooler.
<br>- what you say in your previous comment is not how difficult to execute, I mean to implement that system.
<br>- exactly, one of the proposals is this:
<br>- seems to me a superingenious idea. all the customs that are now part of our life in your day were new ideas "very difficult to put into practice".It would be a question of studying it and improving it.
<br>- I'll leave you this proposal in case you're interested.
<br>- Hello I am the neighbor that after more than a decade of complaints and other andanzas, due to the installation of massive parking lots in an interior and deep housing with uneven level of one floor we have services of cleaning, parks and gardens and infrastructures (machinery of public works and other elements and useful) tourism of employees other vehicles for use of these; also cars of other nearby public services.to complete loading and unloading of mails in the center and door of tolerance.<br>

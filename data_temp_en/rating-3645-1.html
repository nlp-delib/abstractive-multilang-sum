- voted. I propose zones so that dogs can be free and pee-can, voted:
<br>- Thank you for your support, you have mine.
<br>- as a canine educator I see it for nothing.Animal behavior is very complex.What if I bet is for courses on responsible trend, I have given them in kennels and protectors and they work very well.
<br>- good afternoon, bil. sure, animal behavior is complex but I do not see that in an assumption that the city council would organize them it would be to do without having professionals who know their work well. perfect that kennels and protectors organize them, this proposal is not for them to stop doing it, and congratulations for their good functioning, it is about adding, not subtracting. even could be places included in the project, among others. but unfortunately not everyone has a car to move to their location, they are usually far away, is my experience. as a canine educator you would have to be glad that there are more spaces in which love for animals and learning rights and duties is spread..
<br>- it seems to me that canine basic education should be a service of the city council as this investment would benefit the whole community, not only animal owners.I also think that it should include courses of responsible tenure, although this would be directed to another different sector (but this is not for me to judge) and, of course, it would be for the common good.any course that the town council does to improve community coexistence would be welcome.
<br>- good morning, I am also lola. thanks for your contribution. the idea is that the city council offers training opportunities to owners, the approach and the content of them should be studied, see the needs that there are, that they have been seen the lack of respect of each other, and the possibilities of the town council itself. is to take a first step, starting with basic obedience, as are dogs, there is a lot of ignorance about it even though we believe we know, etc.
<br>- the case is to start, in time we could be likened to the level of other countries where it has been possible to reach an optimal level of coexistence.
<br>- the comment is that it is not a course that is in 8 hours, I continuously learn about it, does not consist of going to a talk, my title of canine education, the most basic and the first one that I did were 16 weekends we follow 10 hours on Saturday and 10 on Sunday and I stay short in many aspects the course.
<br>- you stick to something that, for the moment, does not exist. I invite you and other educators to do a project of courses and present it to the city council. it would be thanks of course. many are wishing they existed..
<br>- I have to tell you that canine municipal schools exist in other localities providing a necessary service for the great demand there is. I understand that you do not like the idea, you will see it as competition, but it is necessary that the administration provide spaces that meet the demand of citizens..
<br>- I don't see it as a competition, I dedicate myself to the canine sports world and to working dogs, I just say the obvious, the etology is very complex and very difficult, you have to know how to read the dog, look at its body posture, its emotional state, this is not like cesar millan that comes to a house, it makes the dog indefension and arranged.If you want to guarantee a quality of life to the guide and dog it is necessary to study a lot, see why it is the problem, stimuli, work to perform, distractions and why. if you see it so simple I invite you to take courses of it, work with aggressive dogs, fearful, shy, reactive.
<br>- veterinary etology is studied at the university, the one who wants to dedicate himself professionally is what he would have to do, he would not do courses here and there. etologists there are very few in Spain. as a citizen I ask the administration a way of learning for the owners of dogs. it seems that you find it difficult to understand that there is a vacuum and a problem that needs to be solved. you do not bring any solution to the problem..
<br>- your judgments of value about a non-existent course have very little utility as you will understand, have no foundation, your speech is to yourself because it has nothing to do with what I have proposed..
<br>- good morning bil, how are you? I hope that very well... as you have done before cj in your previous comments, thanking you for your work and appreciating it, I also do it... yet I would like to be able to comment that I fear you have taken yourself in a somewhat defensive way (it is not an attack on your person or any of your professional colleagues) the proposal you have published cj. I think it is certainly a misunderstanding, since at no time does that proposal attempt to supplant the functions and the need for the work you do... I think they are two different things, and I think that the proposal could be a great first step and a wonderful approach for many people with dogs (s), and also for those who do not have or wish to have, to a series of responsibilities and solutions of basic problems that could help greatly to raise awareness about the care, respect and responsibility that our pets entail....
<br>- Thank you, umezza for your input.
<br>- and absolutely would be a fantastic way (of course not the last one, but as cj comments the important thing is that everything adds up and brings its granite into a common cause) that the professionals give you to know your work and you could offer your help... I am not at any time saying that you do not already, and I repeat, all help is little to achieve a goal so important (I am totally convinced that you will agree bil)... it is more, I happily invite you to bring constructive ideas and help enrich the proposal with your experience in the matter, that without any doubt will be a significant and important contribution:) but please avoid on a subject like this (especially being a professional) cynismos of the style "I invite you"... because I believe that they do not contribute much and it is, in the end, to get lost in banalities that I do not believe lead us anywhere. a very cordial greeting, and hope your proposals:) ulises.
<br>- I just saw that the second part has been published first and then the last message hahaha... so I recommend reading it in reverse order:).
<br>- I agree with you cj, the most important thing is to start! and then naturally (as happens with everything) and over time grow in order to be able to offer solution and help to more needs.
<br>- hello umezza, sorry for the delay in answering, I have had a few crazy days of training and sessions and I haven't had almost time.A course of obedience and dog management seemed perfect, but in the proposal it says to learn about dog psychology, which is not turkey mucus, they are very complex behaviors (not all luckily) and you have to hilariously to give with the solution to a problem, it is not a simple training (which is also complex in itself).In the protectors what I do is to give a small seminar of a weekend, about: dog management, dog/guide link, frequent behavior problems in rescued dogs and some guidelines to follow for the first few weeks.Also appreciate the type of education that would be given to the dog (without positive punishment) type of activity that would have, advice at the time of the dog acquisition.if you have bothered my comments I ask for forgiveness, but sometimes you get tired as they disregard your work and dedication.
<br>- bill, in the proposal there is no allusion to learning dog psychology, but "learning about dog psychology", this we do every time we deepen in the knowledge of how dogs are and as far as we live with them, the courses help. in any case it is a colloquial expression. certainly veterinary etology is an experimental science, a level of higher knowledge, that is why it is studied in university. in every case it does not derive from the proposal any disregard to professionals, on the contrary. but your intervention has been aggressive from the beginning, a pity. if I make the proposal is because I take the subject very seriously, I am sorry, but you have lucid.
<br>- hello at no time I have shown aggression no, in fact I am very empathetic with most of the things I read, but also in what I differ I think, there is not much more to say, that it differs in some points does not mean that I do not take the subject seriously, as I have given courses in shelters and kennels, I have also given urban education workshops in madrid center, there are multitude of educators who do it and in very accessible areas.As I say, I would see something better courses of responsible trend, I do want to publish nothing, because I do do not want to do spam, but I have a program of it for those things and treat basic things when it comes to having a dog: education, socialization, training, mild behavior problems but I apologize if you have felt offended, it is not even much less the intention when I write, you see that writing I am really rude.
<br>- the title of the proposal is a simple label, you look at details that deviate you from the topic I want to propose: "municipal canine education courses", it is a generic title, the purpose is to serve to classify the proposal and be found in the searches. I am not announcing any course therefore there is no index of contents, nor nuances. you prefer another title, it seems to me good, anyway if you fix the courses of responsible tenure are courses of education. I see some needs and I make a proposal, because I think that in the long term, if it is carried out would make us a more respectful society and address it to the council because this is the interlocutor. it is very easy to find professionals, schools, books, courses, etc. there is a lot of information that can be accessed on the internet and anyone can find it if you wish, you do the right thing when you do not announce here. insist, consider presenting a project, inform yourself. I accept your apologies.
<br>- and I wish you every success in your work.
<br>- great idea! many dog owners would love to receive some lessons to learn how to treat their pet and can't hire them for the high rates of most specialists.
<br>- Thank you, María for your support. I agree with you. Someday the dogs will be so polite that they will be allowed to take them everywhere and no one will seem strange..
<br>- I loved this proposal!!!!.
<br>- Thank you, dragonfly78, one day we will reach the degree of civicism in other cities, in this matter and in others.
<br>- there's a very good proposal to end dog poop on the street. Please vote it out and give it out.

<br>- there's a very good proposal to end dog poop on the street. Please vote it out and give it out.
<br>- very good proposal. Education is fundamental.
<br>- Greetings alberto, please do not multiply your message over and over again, hinder the dialogue of this proposal. thank you.
<br>- One.
<br>- Two.
<br>- Three.
<br>- Four.
<br>- Five.
<br>- as in another parecity proposal, the owners of the dogs should be fined who carry them loose and without muzzle, besides those who leave the streets of madrid made a tern, more control by the city council.
<br>- no proposal resembles this one, the majority ask that the ordinances, which are very clear, be applied. What would be interesting is the awareness of the citizenry, and it is created by education.
<br>- According to the ordinance, dangerous dogs have to wear muzzles. There's no reason for everyone to wear it.
<br>- I agree more with putting a fee for pets, with the payment of the same would deliver an extract from the regulations, courses, basic care, etc. this implies more responsibility for the owner and would increase the training and knowledge of the regulations so unknown by the current owners and walkers would no longer be a free toy as until now. what does not cost is not valued. I would pay 10 per month for that pet that I care for and gives me affection without doubt.
<br>- I appreciate your interest in knowing the regulations, I suppose you refer to the municipal ordinance on animal possession, I was given it when I was supposed to and registered the dog in the city hall, I don't remember the price I paid. It seems that you don ́t know that it is not free to have them, in addition to the compulsory vaccination every year. as a dog tner already costs, add a rate I don`t see much more sense, although some want to equate the dogs with the cars... those who do not value the dogs won ́t do it for more fees they pay, what I would do is a fine or prison oenas for those who abandon or abuse them, sometimes until they kill them.
<br>- voted: participatory proposal that helps solve the problem: do you disseminate it?:.
<br>- this is the only proposal relating to animal rights which has a minimum chance of obtaining sufficient support, but we must all support it.
<br>- supported. I also propose that the city take it seriously to get the city free of excrement. obviously this goal goes by enabling more and better canine recreation areas
<br>- Thank you very much for your input.
<br>- man, 50 bucks doesn't seem to me a very reasonable price to say...
<br>- it's that man's already spam, he's in tooloodos the topics I've visited, but he doesn't settle for putting it once, no...
<br>- I have not seen any of your proposals, only objections to those of others.
<br>- we are obliged? I do not know if you are Mr Troll who is dedicated to responding to all the comments of others with that little phrase or you are several who seem to know only to say that... if by making a proposal you mean to start one because no, I have not; yet I have supported many others... just as there are so many since I think nothing more than to propose... maybe some people should read a little more what others put before putting 7 "different proposals" that are actually the same, because in that way all they achieve is to divide the supports... and well, you don't deserve to devote so much time and attention to someone who doesn't bother to write anything more than the same little phrase manipulated in response to everything that they propose or comment on others....
<br>- Trolls seeking attention respond paranoidly or pluralizing to personal opinions issued by different individuals according to wikipedia.
<br>- I'll leave you this proposal in case you're interested.
<br>- It would be better if these courses were for those who don't have a dog and want to have it, a kind of permission to have them.
<br>- it would be fine too. The case is that currently the city council does not offer any.
<br>- No, no, no.
<br>- I don't really want everyone's money to go to education courses for dog owners. I think there are priority needs to devote everyone' s money. I would simplify things if you're not civic with your dog that you won't be allowed to have more. so the rest of the citizens don ́t have to put up with shit, loose dogs, and typical phrases like... if you do nothing....
<br>- the money of all subsidizes in part the courses, workshops, etc., that the council organizes, according to interests and needs, as legitimate is a canine education course as it is one of painting, history of art, pilates, etc, some are interested in one thing and others. it seems that some consider that citizens with dog have less rights than the rest.
<br>- I don't think that people who have dogs have fewer rights than the rest. now as it is fashionable to have a dog behaving like a madman for our whim would be more likely to say something against. I just think that it seems to me that the course is unnecessary, who looks for a course of those characteristics will be the one who least needs it, the rest will remain the same. with which money of all thrown. if you say something contrary to the course it may be that it refers to the class and not to something else as the rights or duties of citizens with and without dogs..
<br>- what is unnecessary for you for others is not. Normally one does not point to what does not interest you. you can take a look at the activities organized by the city council, so you could make a list and oppose.<br>

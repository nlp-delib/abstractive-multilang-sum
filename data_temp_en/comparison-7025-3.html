 Yes. I don't believes that people use them properly. the water balloons that I have seen are usually thrown only in the warmer months, July-August and for certain hours. . 
<br>  the model of source outside of those where dogs can drink in a lower overflow but have no access to reach the pipe. it is not clear to me in the proposal whether you refer to sources of drinking water .

i do n't understand how for example in roma there are fountains everywhere and in madrid you see them and you want them to find water in summer
<br>many of us are not sure whether you are referring to drinking water sources

 very expensive, in every way. I would only propose that the model of source outside of those where dogs can drink in a lower overflow but have no access to reach the pipe. for this there is an overflow of water that comes out from above.!!not to waste!! I've talked about waste: teaching children that water is a very precious asset. Sources are not a fun. and denounce these

roma madrid is a city with very high temperatures in summer .
<br>in a city where its water is famous for being very good and with such high temperatures in summer, it is incredible that there are no sources .
<br>the model of source outside of those where dogs can drink in a lower overflow but have no access to reach the pipe. .
<br>if they are sources of drinking .
<br>it is not clear to me in the proposal whether you refer to sources of squares, parks, .<br>

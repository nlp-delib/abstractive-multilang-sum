 a cyclist must occupy 1 lane of traffic... and not go by the edge?. bikes that go along the sidewalks or off the bike lanes should be sanctioned. .

Bikes that go along the sidewalks or off the bike lanes should be sanctioned. The real danger is in the night hours, in which many cyclists go without any light.

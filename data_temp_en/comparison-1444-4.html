 roundabout, It is a metaphor of the life and memory of the victims . 
<br>  the monument is ugly, and I of the biggest attack in Spanish history. . 
<br>  it does not dignify anything the city nor less the homage that was intended to make to the victims of that fateful date. a great missed opportunity to create an emblem of the great historical error.. . 
<br> money. I does not bring anything. a really ugly and not emotional at all. to top it is always ruined and now we are told that they will pay 200,000 euros to fix it??!!!!!! nor talk! there are more useful things to do . 
<br>  don't I have not yet found anyone of any political sign that tells me that it is a pity that it looks dirty and broken, the inside could be dedicated to cultural or tourist information .

 reformed please!!!. Besides, the monument is terribly ugly and unworthy of the biggest attack that has been in Spanish history. I support the reform.. I think what happens to him from the outside is dirt from the exhaust pipes of the vehicles. I also support the proposal to change or make modifications so that we know what it is, since many people who visit us from outside Madrid have no idea what that monument means
<br> a pity that it looks dirty and broken, the haste left this impersonal and ugly monument without any feeling, besides I think nobody likes it. a great missed opportunity. ugly, really ugly and not emotional at all. to top it is always ruined and now we are told that they will pay 200,000 euros to fix it??!!!!!!!!!!! nor talk! but please don't dedicate

the truth is that since lanes were removed, and entering well is a little war. .
<br>it was a metaphor of the life and memory of the victims and light at night would be enough, .
<br>the monument is ugly, and support the proposal to change or make modifications .
<br>i think what happens to him from the outside is dirt from the exhaust pipes of the vehicles. .
<br>i support reform.. .the idea project pointed to a very difficult execution, which was translated into a bluff thanks to the incompetence of the builder, and its initial unfeasibility.
<br>the site could not be more aggressive .
<br>the rushes to lift the monument forced a great builder to simplify it to intolerable .
<br>the winning team designed a monument that doesn't look like the one .
<br>they will pay 200,000 euros to fix the problem .<br>

I think what happens to him from the outside is dirt from the exhaust pipes of the vehicles. regardless of the beauty or not of the monument, the truth is that since it was put a terrible bottleneck was created in that roundabout, since lanes were removed, and entering well is a little war. I support the reform.
<br>This monument was built on the basis of an architectural contest. the winning team designed a monument that doesn't look like the one built. the rushes to lift the monument forced a great builder to simplify it to intolerable limits. in short, it does not represent anyone, dirty the memory, does not bring anything. a great missed opportunity.

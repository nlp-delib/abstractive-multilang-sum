- totally agree, the acoustic pollution is of the highest in cities like madrid. controlling these things makes it much more conducive the coexistence without doubt...
<br>- throwing firecrackers on the street is forbidden by municipal ordinances. I think it would be more appropriate to regulate the sale of pyrotechnic products to private individuals, to avoid possible problems.
<br>- if it is regulated, what is appropriate is that it is enforced, which is good enough for those who hold authority to look elsewhere when they see according to what things (because they see them).
<br>- totally agree, I have the suspicion that certain actions carry a plus on the payroll and others do not. because it is certainly unheard of that they never see the same in front of their noses.
<br>- in order to enforce this prohibition, it would be necessary to have a policeman on every street after the bells (for example). According to the ordinances, it is forbidden both to sell and to turn them on within the municipal term. It would be up to the regular community to sell these devices... it is the only way that I think to tackle this problem.
<br>- in England people are respectful of cleanliness and noises and I don't think there is a cop on every street, but they use many cameras. Maybe it's a good deterrent measure, we lose privacy but we gain tranquility, it is a similar case in my community there were always robberies, and they have put cameras and have ceased,. maybe for cleaning and not throwing garbage, thefts, rapes... can be deterrent..
<br>- in London is very widespread the cctv system in the central area....but I have not seen that deployment in other cities of England. anyway, I hope we do not have to get to that situation....I aspire (and I think all the Madriders) to have more civic neighbors who respect and care for the city in terms of cleaning issues. the issue of surveillance through cameras, seems to me something excessive, worthy of great brother.
<br>- I'm going to set an example that happened to me on January 3rd and that perfectly illustrates the situation that happens dozens of times in the streets of madrid every day. Avenue of the albufera (valleys), about 5 p.m. I was walking on the sidewalk when I heard several meters behind me blow a firecracker. I followed walking and, a couple of meters ahead, blew another one in the middle of the bike lane. Right at that time, on the road, I overstepped a police car, with the driver's window down. the car didn't stop. two firecrapers in less than a minute, the window down, without the lights on that would indicate that they were going to do a service at that moment, and the car continued its trajectory. There is only one possible explanation: they were deaf. so, no, no police on each street, the solution remains the same: to enforce what is established as law. and this serves for a lot more.
<br>Of course, what is forbidden should be respected, but come on, it can only be enforced if you are a witness to incivic behaviour, so I think it would be more useful to veto the sale of these products to individuals, but to say the potential problems that they can create when they exploit.
<br>- said and done.
<br>- Maybe this proposal will improve something that comments more for the police by fines and sanction the following behaviors.

<br>- Pufff, that scares me very much.I don't want a police state without any civil rights.I do not want this to end up becoming a state similar to v de vendetta.
<br>- or vendetta v.
<br>- a complementary noise.multiply to excessively noisy motorcycles. (428 supports)
<br>- you may also be interested in this.Maybe this proposal will improve something that comments more for the police for fines and sanction the following behaviors.
<br>- I am not in favour of giving more to any professional for carrying out tasks that are within his competence, that is, that it is his obligation to carry them out: it would be a contradiction.
<br>- for it is clear, that without more, they do not put them. But come on, that I am open to ideas or suggestions to get them to start putting them (at best, my proposal is not the best).
<br>- I called the city police in 10 minutes last night, they confirmed to me the ban on throwing firecrackers in public at any time. This morning I called again for the same reason and they have punished the "citizens" that according to them the throwing of firecrakers is the spirit of Christmas... blow the customs....
<br>- Hello! Could you tell me what you were in yesterday in the valleys expansion was unbearable. exactly what the police said? if today they pull back I will call but I would like to be informed before.
<br>- we may have to make the same noise as that of the firefighters in order to listen to us. we are many citizens who are against pyrotechnics. how it is possible that a small group of lambs will come out??? remember that the pyrotechnic affects babies, children with autism, animals, people with hearing disorders, etc. is already well!!!!! we cannot allow uncivilized people to bitter us the holidays.<br>

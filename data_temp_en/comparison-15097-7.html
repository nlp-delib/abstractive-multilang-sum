 I I : I I would propose to put clean points in the ccs because for them it is a complaint . 
<br>  the city council can save costs. without taking personal, they can extend the hours of the municipal staff or hire more to collect what is deposited in shopping centers. . 
<br>  the proposal also focuses on obtaining a benefit for recycling. that is why I disagree. it must be recycled . 
<br> I Yes, : if you leave it on the street, case of botellon, there are people need to get a performance to those bottles and also for the sake of cleaning the streets. berl√≠n, an example. and it is a city more or less like madrid. I very much agree with any proposal that improves and increases recycling but...I will share my personal opinion I find no sense in paying an additional amount for each package . 
<br>  he says the media are scarce. At least in my neighborhood.. support and I ask for collaboration to implement network

I think very well this project. even if they don't pay, they have to put more containers in shopping malls. in brick there is currently one of electrical material, batteries and bulbs and ** is filled to overflow** every week. I would propose to put clean points in the ccs because for them it is a complaint and if it is recycled more, it is good for madrid.
<br>I think the important thing is that you recycle as much as possible. It doesn't matter if you do it for money or for conviction. Let's be practical and leave the "purity of heart" for other areas. I find no sense in paying an additional amount for each package to then recover it.

 convenience. I would propose to clean points in the ccs because for them it is good for people to take it to the clean spot and I am in favour of that if there is a pattern and the result is good, you have to support it . 
<br>  the city council can save costs. without taking personal, they can extend the hours of the municipal staff or hire more to collect what is deposited in shopping malls. . 
<br> douglas rushkoff : (and I call for support for proposal to reduce noise pollution. . 
<br>  he says it 's a city more or less like madrid. I very much agree with proposal . 
<br>  he says you recycle as much as possible. It matter if you do it for money . 
<br>  rushkoff : people who have no habit of recycling, will be more interested .

i do not think it 's a profit to recycle and to recover the cost of that packaging that we were previously charged when we purchased it
<br>the solution is called returnable containers , especially for glass bottles . when you return them to the machine they return the price of the helmet
<br>it is done in almost all of europe , and in spain it was done also decades ago
<br>if you give an incentive as small as it is , even if you cover it at the supermarket , people keep it at home and return it to the establishment with its 20 or 30 cents per pack
<br>this happens in many countries of europe and also if you leave it on the street
<br>there are people need to get a performance to those bottles and also for the sake of cleaning the streets

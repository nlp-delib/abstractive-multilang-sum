many car users do not respect traffic lights or speed limits and park in pedestrian and sidewalk steps, endangering pedestrians and cyclists .
<br>if they have motor and registration, are four-wheeled vehicles .
<br>mobility agents and municipal police should ensure to avoid the incivic behaviour of some car drivers.. my god. .
<br>cyclists can record 365 days of the year to different cyclists committing various violations .bicycles must respect traffic rules because they are vehicles, vulnerable, but vehicles and more vulnerable .
<br>many other car drivers do not respect the rules of traffic (non-signal etc.) etc.) .
<br>cyclists speak of 9 out of 10 cars that i have seen with my own eyes do not go to 30 km/h or 50km/hr, of course to protect. pedestrians .
<br>nor should we generalize .he says bikes can share sidewalks with pedestrians .
<br>a car and a motorcycle.the traffic rules are not "more for one than for another".they .
<br>the worst is that the municipal police never intervene. .
<br>i believe that with good intention the two can live .<br>

 incivism. For the debate, what is worse is a cyclist who jumps a traffic light when no-one comes on the road that crosses or a pedestrian crosses a street in red when no one comes and/or without pedestrians? a purpose of traffic rules, is to avoid accidents. which skip them can be due to several reasons, may lack traffic lights and when having to move away it crosses improper
<br> bikes can never go on the sidewalk, but please, the first thing we start to impose fines to offenders who run around where they want to go without respecting the rules of movement. they respect nothing or anyone. they have to run along the road and comply with the regulations of movement like everyone else. bicycles must respect traffic rules because they are vehicles, vulnerable, but vehicles and more vulnerable are still pedestrians..
<br> there are no cops to regulate it, and they go a fashion.I drive a bike, but also a car and a motorcycle.The traffic rules are clear and include bicycles.They are vehicles and they are forbidden to travel along the sidewalks.Is it so difficult to understand?. Mobility officers and the municipal police should ensure to avoid the incivic behaviors of all those who skip the rules.

 the week. I can record 365 days of the year to different municipalities committing violations . 
<br>  the regulation I would like to boast and venture that they know it.. no more bikes running through the sidewalks. bicycles, as they do not have a motor or occupy the same as a car or a motorcycle, perhaps they should have a different regulation than motor vehicles.On . 
<br> I neighbours. Many other car drivers do not respect rules of traffic (non-signal . 
<br>  we have not created a police aimed at chasing them. when a cyclist fails to comply with a normal traffic code, an administrative penalty can be imposed on him as well . 
<br>  the bikes can never go to 30 km/h or 50km/hr, of course to more than 50 kills a cyclist as in the past.That is no excuse for cyclists to be a danger to pedestrians, pedestrians . 
<br> I don't , a car, I , is a constant aggression, motorcycles interrupting the passage, groups along the great road in those two-wheeled armatosts, . 
<br>  it is as if the pedestrians had to ask permission to walk on the sidewalks. the worst is that it goes slower and so long as there is no bike lane, . 
<br>  in madrid today happens in almost all its streets.On the other hand I do not see how many people are complaining here walking like crazy bikes .

<br>the agents of mobility and the municipal police should ensure to avoid the incivic behaviour of some car drivers
<br>i want to say that the only way to know who is responsible in the event of an accident is by applying the norm
<br>many other car drivers also do not respect the rules of traffic
<br>an administrative penalty can be imposed on him as well as on a driver
<br>i believe that with good intention the two can live together . i drive a bike , but also a car and a motorcycle
<br>i do not want to risk my life , nor go out on the road . i do n't want to kill my life '
<br>i believe it is because they know they are n't going to sanction them
<br>if they do n't comply with the rule , it 's because they knew they are not going to sanct them
<br>i 'm sick of bikes being put on sidewalks because madrid is n't prepared for it or his people

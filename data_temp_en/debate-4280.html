- all my support, and I hope the 54 thousand more.
<br>- encourage, madrid, this is if it is a request that can make our city more humane and more supportive..
<br>- madrid, give example and allow children under three years of age to have disabled parking card to receive their treatment. is a shame. do it now....
<br>- this proposal is phenomenal.
<br>- you have all my support that there are many people in need of it and they don't give it to you if they pay attention to a greeting.
<br>- to receive a parking card it is necessary to first have a recognized degree of disability, once recognized you can ask for a car card. the card is not given to the driver or the car, the person is given and has a photo where the holder is accredited. it does not have to drive, there are many people who cannot drive because of their physical condition or simply because they do not know but if they need to move by car and others help them, (other thing is that you use that card improperly, something punished with severe fine and withdrawal of the card). the council allows to circulate with this card the days of traffic restriction. I do not understand the reason for this proposal if in principle I think it is contemplated.
<br>- felix there are many children with a serious illness such as leukemia who do not have a degree of disability so they do not get access to the parking card and children with disabilities regardless of the reduced mobility they have if they are under three years do not grant it because according to the authorities they would have to give it to all children then because at those ages all children have reduced mobility..
<br>- Thank you for the clarification, I did not know these assumptions and I find it very unfair because they have special needs. I sign your proposal.
<br>- it is quite unfair that the parents of children under three years of age who have any serious illness or disability cannot park in spaces for the disabled, are children who must be cared for continuously and brought to a thousand and a specialist the parents must have all the possible help. I think it is asking very little and yet would help them a lot..
<br>- all my support for this proposal. Those affected by multiple chemical sensitivity (sqm) have the same problem... we cannot use public transport because we are sick of the toxics that others use, but we need to go to our medical consultations and treatments in madrid. I am in favour of measures being taken to reduce pollution, but it must be done with order and planning, because unfortunately many of us have no choice but to use private transport.<br>

 traffic. Let's fight against the brutal noise of traffic, let's all fight against traffic. but fighting against music and art seems very wrong to me. it can be played on a regular schedule, at the forbidden night prohibited. the percussion is not noise, it's music. the noise is it of traffic. so selfish posture ruining a person the enjoyment of an entire park, not to mention the noise
<br>. noise. "noise". silence. silence.I believe that a park is a place where many want to enjoy the sounds of nature and also, if possible, some silence.I have not used the word noise." silence. silence...... traffic is the biggest cause of noise in the city, but many pedestrian areas
<br> a link to other proposals of the same, and almost all of the author of the thread. translated: spam.. Most people think you're making noise. We'll have to adapt and accept it. then they'll put a full-volume percussion battery under your window on most sleep at night. donandor is wide enough for there to be a place for everyone, the park of retreat, is

depends on the time . those of us who sleep in front of the park the games of some are annoying of others
<br>if the city council had set you up a park 15 meters from your bedroom like me , you had already tell me the energy you get up the next day
<br>if you read my comment carefully you will see that i have not used the word "noise-.i believe that a park is a place where many want to enjoy the sounds of nature
<br>there are people who work at night and have to rest during the day or simply want to have a reading
<br>when luckily the park is very large , it is necessary to get away many hundreds of meters from the focus of the music to stop hearing it
<br>in madrid there are some very large parks where making music would imply forcing everyone to listen to it
<br>i have seen that you have changed your original proposal and now you limit it to withdrawal , although i still do not like the idea

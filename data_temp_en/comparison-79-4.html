 the timetables of them.It would be containers that could be placed next to the organics, paper or glass. we care madrid. fully agree, . 
<br>  it is already operational. the closer housing is placed the more culture of recycling there will be. you pass a link of the city of Zaragoza. does not generate such a quantity of oils as to have to place another container . 
<br> david......is I are city council trucks that are located in certain areas according to a schedule and do the function of clean points . 
<br>  you can be useful Oh, my God. there is a group of entrepreneurs who collect the oil used in the communities of free neighbors. . 
<br> containers:of course, proposes to collect and transport the garbage through the subway network. . 
<br>  the proposal is not to bother to go to them, it is that it can be an excursion and even so without a car it is complicated to get to them. and clean points . 
<br>  if you look at those clean spots in each neighborhood are itinerant, and their schedules are quite restricted. . 
<br> clean way. I have lived in countries where not only glass was recycled, . 
<br>  it was not the only thing. good morning. seems like a tremendously necessary proposal. . 
<br>  the town council places a mobile recycling unit of sensitive products as can be oil, batteries . 
<br> the clean points are not enough alternative. they are good for throwing TVs, other types of recycling; . 
<br>  many cities have it, what are we waiting for?. with this could also contribute to the production of biodiesel. generating oil culture, we could lower the price of oil and pollute less... . 
<br> some communities of neighbors. and the mobile clean points have a super varied schedule: in the morning a few days, . 
<br>  if everything goes together, it would be interesting to install containers in municipal markets and areas. Oh, no longer know what to do with so much pot . 
<br>  there are many older people that would cost you a lot and couldn't. and less in moratal. the oil is a product of great use .

 neighborhoods or schools. This is a very interesting proposal. I am from Gijon and there the city council for years has installed containers at the entrance of many supermarkets, so it is very easy to recycle the oil: completion of the works of the aquatic center: very important this proposal. Votes this citizen proposal in the following link:. anti-Graphic.
<br> to be followed: Here you all are: if my village (mountijo -ba) has them, why not madrid? until now, I have to put the oil in water bottles, close them well and to waste. if you care about the environment, you would also support this proposal. I also encourage you to learn to make homemade soap with the oil used to wash dishes, etc. is very easy
<br> it is not to bother to go to them, it is that it can be an excursion and even so without a car it is quite complicated to get to them. thanks for the information, but if you look at those clean spots in each neighborhood are itinerant, and their schedules are quite restricted. these things can also accumulate and go to throw them when we have a few. Nor do you need to go
<br> in the neighborhoods themselves. with the collection of furniture. I like your proposal for your environmental interest. it is a great idea.. a good one. a greeting. and a supermarket. a clean spot.. the clean spots are quite far away from the neighborhoods. clean spots. clean spots from the neighborhood....
<br> :). Good morning north-health. I allow myself the freedom to "adopt" your proposal.. I agree with you, in the center, for example, the clean points work only 2 hours and each day are in one place, so it seems a vague because you do not want to go with the trash on the bus to take it to throw it, especially if you don't have your own vehicle
<br>. and the mobile clean points have a super varied schedule: in the morning a few days, in the afternoon others... and that only those of a district. but if you go next door, you have even more scope of schedule. I think it is very necessary just like the container recycling glass, bricks, etc. I don't have any news in madrid of any, and less in moratal

only used cooking oil can be recycled at clean points, .
<br>bringing it closer to neighboring communities would facilitate recycling. .
<br>he says it 's my job to take it to a clean spot that catches me very far from home .
<br>the idea that i started a week ago, but nothing happens, as long as you get great.the only thing i advise you to edit .is very easy, recycle oil , '' says oil .
<br>city council trucks are located in certain areas .
<br>the works of the aquatic center thank you very .
<br>if you care about the environment, you would also support this .
<br>encourage you to make homemade soap with the oil used to wash dishes, .proposals proposing the burial of containers:of course, the collection of oil already done at the clean .
<br>this proposal does not make much sense, i think. .
<br>it is not to bother to go to them, it can be an excursion .
<br>the problem that many would use to make oil from cars, is a different point, too many companies that do it to get biodiesel add another proposal please
<br>propose to collect and transport the garbage through the subway .
<br>the proposal should not wait to have enough .the : oil not to end up in general garbage (at best) or directly in pipes .
<br>the laziness of citizens to recycle is an excuse not to support the proposal, but if it is its motive, .
<br>following its logic , taking into account the feasibility would be absurd .
<br>lastly add that not many years ago there was only a bucket of garbage for everything. .
<br>i have lived in countries where not only glass was done by colors, .they : oil in the kitchens of our homes and restaurants (let's .
<br>as i think it is the most votes, i will withdraw .
<br>the clean points are not enough .
<br>this is extremely important .the mobile clean points have a super varied schedule: in the morning others... .
<br>i refuse to throw it down the drain. .
<br>if you go next door (which stay myu you have even more scope of schedule. .
<br>they visit the proposal that proposals over 100 can not be deleted each year with more than 100 .<br>

It would be easier to increase the number of mobile clean points and the timetables of them. It would not be wrong to leave a container for it (which are usually smaller than those of glass or paper) near metro stations (in neighborhoods) or schools. The closer the housing is placed the more culture of recycling.
<br>I support this proposal and ask you to please support the completion of the works of the aquatic center. I also encourage you to learn to make homemade soap with the oil used to wash dishes, etc. It doesn't cost to carry an oil boat as you're on your way. It's no better solution but you can be useful.
<br>The collection of oil is already done at the clean points. The problem is that people are vague when it comes to recycling. The logical thing is to have containers of the most usual things (organic, packaging, paper and glass) and for the rest have a center where you can leave the rest of things to recycle.
<br>There are containers in supermarkets so you don't have to move to a clean spot. I have lived in countries where not only glass was recycled, it was done by colors, and it was not the only thing. I think it is very good idea that in the supermarkets there are containers of collection of oil.
<br>There are already clean points to leave the oil, I hope no one throws it through the sink... but it seems good to me, give more facilities so that we can throw it in distributed containers and placed together those of glass and paper. generating oil recycling culture, we could lower the price of oil and pollute less... we are already slow!
<br>I think it's fine, but under a restriction, how do you identify who pours and what oil pours? What would happen if some "citizen" pours vehicle oil, if everything goes together, it couldn't be differentiated. I no longer know what to do with so much pot with used oil because I refuse to throw it down the drain.

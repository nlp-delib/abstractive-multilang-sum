 not for drinking alcohol, as if you take sulfuric acid, who cares?. but for sluts, pigs and troublemakers. a 600 penalty is crazy, a punishment is normal but having worse sanctions for drinking than for smoking you or hitting someone on the street is something disproportionate. you should learn to have respect for people and not to speak without knowing things well. everyone has

 follows: I'll 's question is as follows: would a rise in sanctions really eradicate alcohol consumption on the public road? in my opinion at all. . 
<br>  the punishment does not fall on the parents alone, but on the cause of the annoyances. you'd better go to college .

Neil, I recommend reading my proposals, I have now helped a young man to plead, to appeal the sanction, at this time this pending resolution in the administrative court of madrid against madrid sant√©. I am against the imposition of unfair fines for drinking alcohol publicly. I leave you one of my proposals in case you want to support it.

the acoustic pollution is of the highest in cities like madrid. .

.... I have the suspicion that they never see the same in front of their noses, and others do not.. totally agree, the issue of surveillance through cameras, seems to me something excessive, worthy of great brother.. in Madrid, I don't think there is a policeman on every street after the bells (for example), but they use many cameras.. if it is regulated

Maybe this proposal will improve something that comments more for the police by fines and sanction the following behaviors.

Throwing firecrackers on the street is forbidden by municipal ordinances. I think it would be more appropriate to regulate the sale of pyrotechnic products to private individuals. The issue of surveillance through cameras, seems to me something excessive, worthy of great brother. I aspire to have more civic neighbors who respect and care for the city in terms of cleaning issues.
<br>I'm going to set an example that happened to me on January 3rd and that perfectly illustrates the situation that happens dozens of times in the streets of madrid every day. I was walking on the sidewalk when I heard several meters behind me blow a firecracker. I followed walking and, a couple of meters ahead, blew another one in the middle of the bike lane. Right at that time, on the road, I overstepped a police car, with the driver's window down. The car didn't stop. There is only one possible explanation: they were deaf.

the acoustic pollution is of the highest in cities like madrid
<br>it is forbidden both to sell and to turn them on within the municipal term
<br>in england people are respectful of cleanliness and noises and i don't think there is a cop on every street
<br>i think it would be more useful to veto the sale of these products to individuals
<br>but to say the potential problems that they can create when they exploit
<br>i do n't want a police state without any civil rights . i do not want this to end up becoming a state similar to v de vendetta , or vendetta v.

- I think very well this project. even if they don't pay, they have to put more containers in shopping malls. in brick there is currently one of electrical material, batteries and bulbs and ** is filled to overflow** every week and they leave things on the ground because they do not fit. so it is better for people to take it to the shopping mall than to the clean spot and I am in favour of that if there is a pattern and the result is good, you have to support it and it is not a matter of political ideas. it is for convenience. I would propose to put clean points in the ccs because for them it is a complaint and if it is recycled more, it is good for madrid. moreover, the city council can save costs. without taking personal, they can extend the hours of the municipal staff or hire more to collect what is deposited in shopping centers.
<br>- I don't think it's right that you pay for recycling. It's something that you should educate and that people do it out of awareness, because tomorrow the machine gets ruined or they take them off and neither does God recycle because it doesn't get a benefit.
<br>- the solution is called returnable containers, especially for glass bottles. when you return them to the machine they return the price of the helmet. then they wash them and they are used again. it is done in almost all of Europe, and in Spain it was done also decades ago, but for some reason we lost it.
<br>- I do not think it is a profit to recycle and to recover the cost of that packaging that we were previously charged when we purchased it.In the 1970s it was already done here in Spain: the helmets were lowered to the store and it was deducted from the amount of the purchase. the concept of returnable packaging was cleaner and ecological than that of recyclable packaging, since that packaging was reused....
<br>- to me the shopkeeper gave me a gum for every litre of beer that he carried. and as he says, the rest of the people did it for recovering money, but not for recycling, that was secondary. at the time when it stopped being done, the people stopped recycling (well, it is true that that time did not exist recycling as such). the proposal also focuses on obtaining a benefit for recycling. that is why I disagree. it must be recycled because it is right for the environment, not because they are going to give you 20 cents of a packaging that cost you 1 euro.
<br>- reason or business economic interests?. you know.
<br>- forgive the intrusion, but this proposal seems very important to me (and it is not mine)
<br>I call for support for this proposal which seeks to reduce night noise pollution.
<br>- Yes, I totally agree with you, but if you give an incentive as small as it is, even if you cover it at the supermarket, people keep it at home and return it to the establishment with its 20 or 30 cents per pack. this happens in many countries of Europe and also if you leave it on the street, case of botellon, there are people need to get a performance to those bottles and also for the sake of cleaning the streets. berl√≠n, an example. and it is a city more or less like madrid.
<br>- I very much agree with any proposal that improves and increases recycling but...I will share my personal opinion I find no sense in paying an additional amount for each package to then recover it.It would be much simpler to directly separate the packages.It is a pity that a system of this style is needed for such a simple issue, that it requires a minimum effort and that when there is a kind of "reward" we begin to be interested.
<br>- I think the important thing is that you recycle as much as possible. It doesn't matter if you do it for money or for conviction. let's be practical and leave the "purity of heart" for other areas. on the other hand it would be advisable to be informed about the big recycling business and in which hands you are in.
<br>- seems to me a good starting point!! so people who have no habit of recycling, will be more interested and in the future will be a custom acquired, that is done more by the fact of contributing to the environment than by the money received!.
<br>- I see it as an incentive too, so people will.
<br>- I think that in the end we would raise the price of the product bought to then be able to pay the packaging, we have to recycle by conscience to be civic and educate, on the contrary to fine the one who does not, especially if they are companies, recycle an obligation of all, it is my opinion..
<br>- That's the issue. That recycling ultimately costs taxpayers money. Besides that the media are scarce. At least in my neighborhood..
<br>- support and I ask for collaboration to implement network cameras that record incivic behaviors
<br>- very good idea, I'd like you to see mine, very necessary in the area, thank you.
<br>- Good idea.
<br>- as in Berlin.
<br>- Civicism is a scarce good, there are also those who recycle and then those who collect it mix everything. and those who throw cans into the street having the trash in front. to see without the payment ("for interest I want you to go") some people are akin to recycling.<br>

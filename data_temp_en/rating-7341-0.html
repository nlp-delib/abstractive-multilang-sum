- it also weighs the name of carabanchel, as in the expansion of valleys? at last....
<br>- It must weigh on you. Anyway, the thought thinker.
<br>- but, carabanchel pau is the neighborhood of bonavista, what happens that is called colloquially. I understand that the name should not be changed, but use the one that really has. the pau, is the plan of urban action that developed in the area, but the neighborhood is bonaviste.
<br>- Like high and low, there should be new carabanchel.
<br>- totally agree.
<br>- What's wrong with the name carabanchel? those we were born and lived in the neighborhood are not to blame that in the 1940s they built a political prison outside the neighborhood (which is now rent) and that unfortunately they gave him the name of the neighborhood.
<br>- That's a good idea.
<br>- It's wrong. Bonavista is a piece of carabanchel.
<br>- I don't understand why! there's nothing wrong with "carabanchel". The only bad thing is that they put the same name to a political prison that they built in the 40s outside of the neighborhood.If it's for a classic theme, maybe you should know that carabachel was a summer town for nobility. although I prefer its connotation as a working-class neighborhood and vindictive.
<br>- effectively bonavista is another neighborhood of carabanchel other than pau....and I don't think it weighs the surname of carabanchel, if not the name of pau that is simply the acronym of program of urbanistic performance, something like new carabanchel or similar would look better.<br>

Eating kosher, not eating pork, or doing holy week does not invalidate the options that these exclude. I put veganism / vegetarianism here. I can be vegan for reasons of __________________________, but I must not deprive my children of what they want to eat if they find that it satisfies them and does not harm them. My criteria do not have to be their own.
<br>I am not creating a comparative aggravation among children who have health problems and vegetarians. 90% of vegans/vegetarians are for reasons of awareness against animal abuse. I do not impose anything on my family but the system that is scripted by the meat and milk industry does impose on us what is "normal"
<br>Each one is free to choose a way of life, but must not pretend that others assume it. Do the others not want to assume that each one in choosing his way of living can have that alternative for the education of his children? assume what? that my son on the day he touches meat instead of chicken steak put mushrooms that for certain many cheaper?
<br>Children must know what it is to eat meat, eggs and milk because the culture in which they live also eat them, then, with the example of example at home, adequate information and adulthood, that they choose what they think best. isolating children is not a good solution when they start their socialization.

 if I am not mistaken, being vegan/vegetarian is a choice. being lactose intolerant, gluten, or some kind of food . 
<br>  I must not deprive my children of what they want to eat if they find that it satisfies them . 
<br>  a person who is neither vegan nor vegetarian should not care about eating a vegetarian or vegan meal...... at "normal" restaurants it is very difficult to eat a day menu without meat . 
<br> it. I : it. am not creating a comparative aggravation among children who have health problems and vegetarians. I'm asking you not to compare it . 
<br>  the system that is scripted by the meat and milk industry does impose on us what is "normal" on our table . 
<br>  it is a more offer for parents than for children. because parents have already chosen to be Vegan, but a child still does not have the ability to discern... if he had all, all the information, he could choose. but at 7, 8 or 10 years, hardly.
<br> there is a choice of natural food 100%, ecological, sustainable, without additives. in which case, it is not a request, but a requirement!! I don't know what you have read that has led you to this conclusion. I am reading from the part of what he proposes, it seems to me that the thing is going to be more . 
<br>  the child does not understand, he doesn't understand if there is anything else to choose one way or another: to be normal . 
<br> the livestock industries are so many children who need school meals to feed themselves, . 
<br>  they 're tied up with hands!. We're going to move this proposal all over the corners to see if we can get them to take it into account. Let's . 
<br>  the proposal among everyone, please, that needs a lot of support. Thank you very much. I .

 a choice. and that is why, unlike gluten-free or salt-free food, is not available. is an election, which I respect, that parents must carry out at home or where they consider. let's leave schools out of fashion. a vegan or vegetarian person cannot eat meals that are served "normally" but a person who is neither vegan nor vegetarian should not care about eating a vegetarian or
<br> fashion is respectable, sergio, no longer wears itself. a kiss, sasha.. is that a child does not know whether he wants to be vegan or not. if he had all, all the information, he could choose. but at 7, 8 or 10 years, hardly. he may be headed for vegan/vegetarian routes and end up reneging
<br> I don t get obsessed with it. let it flow. kisses. the choice of a meal with meat or fish is also an election. sahsa but for the same reason a child does not know if he wants to eat meat, fish, vegetables, ovolacteos. without exclusion. he does not understand. what he likes.
<br> a lot of support. Thank you very much. at house, what we want.. you didn't understand the proposal. I recommend you read the opinions of the other participants and my answers. Hi sasha, sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. I apologize for the comments. thank you, karimakrf. I fully support your proposal.. hug. We're going to move

 douglas rushkoff : children the problem is more serious, because almost always the children are imposed on the religion of the parents, . 
<br>  he says I must not deprive children of what they want to eat if they find it satisfies them and does not harm them. My criteria . 
<br>  he says it 's a choice, I do not think it should exist as an option in the school dining rooms. it is not a question of illness or medical limitation, . 
<br> it. I is a respectable choice as to choose to educate children under some kind of religion that prevents them from eating certain foods. . 
<br>  the system is scripted by the meat and milk industry does impose on us what is "normal" on our table . 
<br>  a child does not know whether he wants to be vegan or not. as far as I am concerned they can offer it, . 
<br> it. Do is a genius for the education of his children? . 
<br>  he does not put it? if we are going through the hoop to be normal . 
<br>  the system, consider uninformed and handled with meat and milk companies has to decide to blow up what our children have to eat. . 
<br> I It is to live without using animals in any way. Thank you, . 
<br>  you've have is in a public school and wants to opt for the dining room . 
<br>  the proposal is among the people we have chosen to feed ourselves consciously, .

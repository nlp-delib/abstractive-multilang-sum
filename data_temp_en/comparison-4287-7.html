Many car users do not respect traffic lights or speed limits and park in pedestrian and sidewalk steps, endangering pedestrians and cyclists and causing accidents. cars, even if they have motor and registration, are four-wheeled vehicles and are bound by the same traffic rules as motorcycles or bicycles. Mobility agents and municipal police should ensure to avoid the incivic behaviour of some car drivers.
<br>Bicycles must respect traffic rules because they are vehicles, vulnerable, but vehicles and more vulnerable are still pedestrians. Many other car drivers also do not respect the rules of traffic (non-signal laps, speed limits, etc.) and we have not created a police aimed at chasing them. When a cyclist fails to comply with a normal traffic code, an administrative penalty can be imposed on him.
<br>I'm sick of bikes being put on, because madrid isn't prepared for it or his people. It's like a fashion, but there's no bike lane, and there are no cops to regulate it. You have to be the one to give in if you don't want an accident. Anyone who can cause an accident, are not more preferable than others.

<br>  it is as if the pedestrians had to ask permission to walk on the sidewalks. the worst is that it goes slower and so long as there is no bike lane, .

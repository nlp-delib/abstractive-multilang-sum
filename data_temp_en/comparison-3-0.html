and where would 3.165,000 trees be planted
<br>that the trees can be planted and are convenient, but not one for each madrider
<br>that has already been done and stopped doing as inoperative
<br>it 's a way for everyone to become aware
<br>madrid is a fairly populated city of trees . it is rare to see a street without them
<br>there are many areas of madrid that there are no houses and could be planted
<br>it is as if they decide not to make any more cars because there are traffic accidents

<br>there is a private and non-profit initiative that is already being done in combination with the staff of the retreat and the support of the ayto de madrid
<br>i support this proposal but better than 1 tree a madridn would be better 10 trees per madridn there are plenty of land added a similar proposal

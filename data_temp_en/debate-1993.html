- Do you find it unrestrictive the schedule in which dogs can be released in the park?? "In the morning until 10am and in the afternoon from 7pm. in the summer, in the morning till 10am, and inthe afternoon from 8pm. "I really can't understand this antipathy!! it's as if to me the children released when they go to school. (And yes, my dog is much better educated than many of those children).
<br>- Well, whatever dog you have, I assure you, and I'll prove to you whenever you want, that he's much more polite than children, and so on than parents.
<br>- imposing fines for carrying loose dogs and imposing a municipal fee on dog owners.
<br>- children or people with dogs should not be compared in any way.
<br>- decide openly that you don't like dogs and we're done before.
<br>- voted. I propose zones so that dogs can be free and pee-can, voted:
<br>- fine the owners of dogs who are walked loose, as well as those who because they are of an aggressive race do not wear bozal.
<br>- It's true, not even a point of comparison, dogs are much more polite than 90% of the kids now.
<br>- What a narcissism!
<br>- repeated proposal<br>

Cleaning is one of the parts of a society that we have to take care of all without exception. I do not understand why they do not put general containers, both of organic waste as well as of others. The only solution is to expand the sidewalks, since the centralized containers would involve such a number of them.
<br>I think it's great to detect the problem. how to solve it: (easy!!);) make on the roads that have parking for vehicles a space of 90 cm wide, in front of the portals. with two goes (as if it were the entrance to a garage) that delimits a space for the cube or cubes. not to the garbage bins on the sidewalks.
<br>I believe that there is no desire to make life easier for people and that does not give a vote. These are very unpopular measures to remove outposts in the streets where the sidewalks are narrow and we can't even walk. In those squares to put underground garbage systems, that there isn't dirt neither the street nor bad smells.

 Good but, : we pay more to the company that does the service of taking out and putting the cubes because the person who comes has to charge night time . 
<br>  we have only two 2 hours to lower the garbage? by live done the sidewalks are so narrow that you do not empty cabs with a wheelchair and the baby cars carry them on the road. we could take all the garbage to your house . 
<br> the sidewalks. I is the most viable option, other than that you can lower the trash at any time of the day . 
<br>  the only viable solution would be the installation of underground containers, which require a certain investment, while we will have to live with the buckets, at least this way . 
<br> the urban cleaning service is deficient. in other cities much care is taken to clean the container areas. I . 
<br>  the cohe has more priority than a person, they do have to have the right to park, even if people can't even go through the sidewalks.There are solutions, limit parking areas .

 become dirt spots as is now the case with the cardboard and furniture pick-up points. Please vote: martina, what possibility do you find if the truck on my street passes over twelve o'clock in the night? by live done the sidewalks are so narrow that you do not empty cabs with a wheelchair and the baby cars carry them on the road. the image of the cubes is
<br>. Yes because it was going to be the showy madrid center with general containers to store garbage at any time of the day with garbage cubes on the sidewalks.. of course it is uncomfortable about the cube(s).. yes sir, very good idea!. make on the roads that have parking for vehicles a space of 90 cm wide, in front of the portals, with two goes (
<br> in many cities and capitals of province. The investment has to do it as has already been done already years ago in many provinces and cities. greetings. the urban service is poor and the urban population is even more deficient. I believe that there is no desire to make life easier for people and that does not give a vote. On the contrary, the car gives a lot of votes.

 people, I is one of the parts of a society that we have to take care of all without exception, it is as important as the safety of a city or health for people, if we have insanity in a city we run a lot of risk . 
<br>  the company does the service of taking out and putting the cubes because the person who comes to charge time and we have only 2 hours to lower the garbage? by live done the sidewalks . 
<br> the sidewalks. I street where I live 80 percent are on sidewalks) there is no spare space to park, . 
<br>  it is the most viable option, other than that you can lower the trash at any time of the day and encourage recycling. it is true . 
<br>  there are underground containers. on the road there are openings to deposit the trash and also with option of recycling on each street. . 
<br> urban cleaning service is deficient. in other cities much care is taken to clean the container areas. . 
<br>  many streets, like mine, are very unpopular measures to remove outposts in the streets where sidewalks are narrow . 
<br>  the majority of streets, in the center of madrid, are usually dated about hs. at that time it is transited through the street with carts of children .

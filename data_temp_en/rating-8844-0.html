- no, at least as long as you do not explain the justification of such tax.the arrival of tourists to the city already results in a source of income for the city council through taxes to all the activities it carries out (payment of accommodation, food, purchases or any other activity) so I do not see the justification that they pay another tax more.As well, one person because of the fact of doing tourism is not necessarily richer than another, neither has more goods, nor presents any distinguishing characteristic that motivates them to pay taxes that other collectives do not pay.
<br>- the justification is simple, its end is solidarity. is a fee that is paid in many European cities, usually to tourist accommodation. here what is proposed is that it is for solidarity purposes. or is that our own interests do not let us be solidarity? on the other hand I do not find in the text of the proposal where it is said that tourists are richer because of the mere fact of traveling. of course there are budgets for all tastes..
<br>- it seems to me that she has not understood well what the promoter exposes. it is a solidarity rate. if we have money to see a city and enjoy its services, that by the way, they pay their neighbors. sure it is not very burdensome, pay one, per night for a solidarity purpose. even in order to make the city more welcoming to everyone.
<br>- I know that there is a similar proposal, earlier and with more support in the list of unrepealed proposals: I can't find it right now.It would be useful if the support were not dispersed.
<br>What I wanted to say is that it seems fair to me that a tourist should be "forced" to be in solidarity.You justify the tax in which he is in solidarity, but applying that principle could impose a solidarity tax on the owners of animals or even on those of the parks.And that is why I argue that if such solidarity is needed, it applies to the irpf rather than to a specific group.
<br>- the services I understand it and it is certainly unfair for the registered persons to pay through taxes a service that is subsequently taken advantage of by other people; but right now the only service that I think about is public transport.to this problem I come up with two other solutions apart from the solidarity tax:1. consider that ultimately the inhabitants of Madrid also do tourism and for each other. (It is also true that not all Madridns leave, although they make greater use in the time of the services of the city council, so it comes to be compensated).2. to charge visitors a price different from that of those registered by the municipal public services, to compensate for the subsidized part of the consistory. thus, tourists who enjoy these services do not benefit from the taxes of the registered person and, in turn, those tourists who do not use these services are not forced to pay for them.
<br>Finally, I think it is important to bear in mind that Madrid is the capital of Spain and that for this reason, there are many people who have to come here for administrative reasons and are forced to spend the night in a city outside of their own, while the inhabitants themselves of the capital can save such journeys and incestary expenses.
<br>- in the end I found it: tax overnight hotel. (25 supports) since you have less support than your proposal, I'm going to include yours in the list of unrepealed proposals.
<br>- I thank you for your management but I would like to point out that the end of my proposal is solidarity (I already explain in the body of the proposal some of the possible destinations) at no time wish that the collected is destined to the coffers of the city council for that we already have managers who have and must work to not leave them empty. in any case seems to me a great initiatory yours and very laborious. thanks for this and encourage the citizens to continue voting us.
<br>- therefore with more reason to have included it also, although I find it more interesting yours.a see if we can get them to reduce the demand to 10,000 support so that they can move to the next stage of voting.proposed with 10,000 votes, not 53,000. (41 support)<br>

 3.165,000 trees be planted. And if new trees are planted, or if it is appreciated that some are not treated as they correspond, to solve it. I'm not against the trees. Everything you tell me I share, but one for Madrid is childish. Planting trees seems fine to me, but I would have to see the care given to them... that has already died more than one for the fall of
<br> a new style of gardening.. as more wild... Madrid how much with many trees and lots, very much green surface.. just as there is, I don't know it, but so I see at least in my neighborhood the feeling is quite lax... an integral plan with a detailed record that there is planted, that it is to be replaced, infrastructure, expenditure, etc. I support the proposal. another proposal
<br> replanting with trees areas adjacent to madrid. in vicalvaro there is a decorative source in which recently ducks fly and swim in it. I would like them to plant more trees where I have never seen more variety than sparrows, which by the way suffer the rigors of summer as none. so more trees in the peeled areas of the parks, for the sake of everyone

 if a tree dies does not put another one again to stop doing the wild cuttings that have been practiced, in some cases . 
<br>  many do not see a drop of water in years. if they are planted new trees, please take into account their needs, their development, . 
<br> the project cards, is a new style of gardening.. . 
<br>  it is rare to see a street without them. the important thing is to give good care . 
<br>  the controversy is not such. to propose to plant one tree per citizen, does not take away . 
<br> the proposal that proposals over 100 can not be deleted each year with more than 100 support. (40 support) to prevent something like this (a period of arbitrary proposals), from happening again or from happening to the next proposals that are in the foreground. I would like to invite you to notify all your supporters by notification so that they visit the proposal . 
<br>  better than 1 tree a Madridn would be better 10 trees per Madridn there are plenty of land added a similar proposal It seems to me a good initiative, .

It's a way for everyone to become aware. Of course you can... there are pages where you can plant trees, for 10... imagine a city council, it would be much cheaper. And where would 3.165,000 trees be planted? That has already been done and stopped doing as inoperative.
<br>Madrid is a fairly populated city of trees. It is rare to see a street without them. The important thing is to give good care to those we have. Maybe it would be necessary to repopulate large areas such as brown and surrounding madrid. It may be more practical to put it in value.
<br>Madrid gardening service is low and every year it happens is worse, without resources and without staff. There are streets in madrid where they have done so. It could be generalized. who does not like that in your street there are trees, birds and such joy!:-).

<br>that the trees can be planted and are convenient, but not one for each madrider
<br>that has already been done and stopped doing as inoperative
<br>it 's a way for everyone to become aware
<br>madrid is a fairly populated city of trees . it is rare to see a street without them
<br>there are many areas of madrid that there are no houses and could be planted
<br>it is as if they decide not to make any more cars because there are traffic accidents
<br>madrid 's gardening service is low and every year it happens is worse, without resources and without staff
<br>there is a private and non-profit initiative that is already being done in combination with the staff of the retreat and the support of the ayto de madrid
<br>i support this proposal but better than 1 tree a madridn would be better 10 trees per madridn there are plenty of land added a similar proposal

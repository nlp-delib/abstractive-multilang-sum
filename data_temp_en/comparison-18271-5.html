 a sr. had a thermometer of the water type, and came out, and there even with air conditioning, and in my house is a room, and its roof is not well insulated, and living at more than 40 degrees......., it is hell, I don't know it but it has consequences for health, even hanging towels from the terrace door, alters sleep, disturbs stress,

<br>in the case of natural gas heating , these never come from natural gas

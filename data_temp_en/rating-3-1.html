- And where would 3.165,000 trees be planted?
<br>- that the trees can be planted and are convenient, but not one for each Madrider. That has already been done and stopped doing as inoperative.
<br>- It's a way for everyone to become aware. Inoperative, why? Of course you can... there are pages where you can plant trees, for 10... imagine a city council, it would be much cheaper, we would live in a cleaner city and free of pollution and with less heat in summer, etc....breathe good air, madrid is very contaminated, think about what children breathe in your city...
<br>- there are so many places to plant them, in the same country house you can plant many more trees, and I don't tell you about places by madrid that are dry that could be planted many more.....
<br>- I'm assuming that the secarrals you name will be municipal soil and not private land that died of laughter.
<br>- I'm not against the trees. Everything you tell me I share, but one for Madrid is childish.
<br>- Planting trees seems fine to me, but I would also have to see the care given to them... that has already died more than one for the fall of these.
<br>- Wouldn't it be better to look after and keep the ones we already have? If we plant more trees, the chances of one falling on our head increase... eye... that many are already falling....
<br>- it is a too ambitious objective, I think the best thing would be: - to review the existing tree and its state, - to heal, cutting all those that can pose a danger - to replant each tree cut, not as now that if a tree dies does not put another one again - to stop doing the wild cuttings that have been practiced, in some cases - also in the opposite direction, to realize them when the tree needs it. I have seen both cases in my neighborhood. - and if new trees are planted, or if it is appreciated that some are not treated as they correspond, to solve it. there are trees that are watered but many do not see a drop of water in years. - if they are planted new trees, please take into account their needs, their development, if it can affect installations, houses, etc. - not only plant bananas or chops.
<br>- all this leads to what someone was saying, an integral plan with a detailed record that there is planted, that it is to be replaced, infrastructure, expenditure, etc... just as there is, I don't know it, but so I see at least in my neighborhood the feeling is quite lax. the people who visit me from other cities have this same impression, at least so they manifest it to me. they see the dirty, dry gardens, full of dog shit, dead spaces or with four cards, eye that I have nothing against the jjajaja cards, just like it is a new style of gardening.. as more wild...
<br>- Madrid how much with many trees and lots, very much green surface. It may be more practical to put it in value, managing parks, gardens and forest areas correctly and above all, with the right means.
<br>- exact maria. madrid is a fairly populated city of trees. it is rare to see a street without them. the important thing is to give good care to those we have.maybe it would be necessary to repopulate large areas such as brown and surrounding madrid.
<br>- in theory the detailed record already exists... I don't see it so ambitious, it can be done in several phases and several years... actually you have to take care of what there is, but also plant more trees, there are many areas of madrid that there are no houses and could be planted.
<br>- effectively take care of and maintain the ones that are there. Accidents happen, it is as if they decide not to make any more cars because there are traffic accidents.
<br>- I'm going to look at the page, I didn't know her, thanks for the info.
<br>- the controversy is not such. to propose to plant one tree per citizen, does not take away that the public parks are maintained and cared for, rather it is a measure that complements the other. to feel responsible and to care for our trees, is also to do pedagogy. in any case, it is not necessary to carry out this initiative in a week, but to launch the project and gradually improve it, creating without cost or basic cost, nurseries managed by the Madridns, in places in disuse, that will later be used for this task. I support the proposal.
<br>- another proposal in that sense. This is the link
<br>- place there is, and need also. there are streets where its non-existence produces a huge sensation of aridity. if the streets are narrow and do not fit in the sidewalks, then you can enable the parking area of the road, for example, you plant a tree between half of every 3-4 cars parked so that from corner to corner you can put 6-7 trees and there are barely left parking space. There are streets in madrid where they have done so. it could be generalized. who does not like that in your street there are trees, birds and such joy!:-).
<br>- madrid: 2nd city of the world with more wooded online.
<br>- Oh, my God.
<br>- Madrid gardening service is low and every year it happens is worse, without resources and without staff.
<br>- there is a private, private and non-profit initiative that is already being done in combination with the staff of the retreat and the support of the ayto de madrid, I tell you of the association we plant trees; I believe it and lead it a marriage that pays all the expenses 80% with their salaries, the text are contributions of the partners..
<br>- I like the idea of tree seed burials better, or also the foodfree project idea. can be consulted in google.
<br>- I support this proposal but better than 1 tree a Madridn would be better 10 trees per Madridn there are plenty of land added a similar proposal
<br>It seems to me a good initiative, but it would be essential that the people of Madrid could participate, especially the children, in this planting of trees.
<br>- this proposal can be included in this more generic one: repopulate with trees areas adjacent to madrid.
<br>- in vicalvaro there is a decorative source in which recently ducks fly and swim in it. since new species of birds are appearing, as well as the black eye, I would like them to plant more trees where I have never seen more variety than sparrows, which by the way suffer the rigors of summer as none. the heat waves pull them out of the nests without knowing how to fly and sometimes kills them the heat of asphalt. so more trees in the peeled areas of the parks, for the sake of everyone, that replenish them, and fill all the possible surface. and then we would understand what to sow showy flowers in small public parks.
<br>- I would like to invite you to notify all your supporters by notification so that they visit the proposal that proposals over 100 can not be deleted each year with more than 100 support. (40 support) to prevent something like this (a period of arbitrary proposals), from happening again or from happening to the next proposals that are in the foreground.

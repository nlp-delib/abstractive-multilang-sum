Cleaning is one of the parts of a society that we have to take care of all without exception. I do not understand why they do not put general containers, both of organic waste as well as of others. The only solution is to expand the sidewalks, since the centralized containers would involve such a number of them.
<br>I think it's great to detect the problem. how to solve it: (easy!!);) make on the roads that have parking for vehicles a space of 90 cm wide, in front of the portals. with two goes (as if it were the entrance to a garage) that delimits a space for the cube or cubes. not to the garbage bins on the sidewalks.
<br>I believe that there is no desire to make life easier for people and that does not give a vote. These are very unpopular measures to remove outposts in the streets where the sidewalks are narrow and we can't even walk. In those squares to put underground garbage systems, that there isn't dirt neither the street nor bad smells.

 people, I is one of the parts of a society that we have to take care of all without exception, it is as important as the safety of a city or health for people, if we have insanity in a city we run a lot of risk . 
<br>  the company does the service of taking out and putting the cubes because the person who comes to charge time and we have only 2 hours to lower the garbage? by live done the sidewalks . 
<br> the sidewalks. I street where I live 80 percent are on sidewalks) there is no spare space to park, . 
<br>  it is the most viable option, other than that you can lower the trash at any time of the day and encourage recycling. it is true . 
<br>  there are underground containers. on the road there are openings to deposit the trash and also with option of recycling on each street. . 
<br> urban cleaning service is deficient. in other cities much care is taken to clean the container areas. . 
<br>  many streets, like mine, are very unpopular measures to remove outposts in the streets where sidewalks are narrow . 
<br>  the majority of streets, in the center of madrid, are usually dated about hs. at that time it is transited through the street with carts of children .

it is as important as the safety of a city or health for people
<br>if we have insanity in a city we run a lot of risk in all aspects
<br>the points to deal with about cleaning are quite interesting
<br>there is no need to make exaggerated investments
<br>i would see it the most viable option for that you can lower the trash at any time of the day and encourage recycling
<br>it is true that there is no spare space to park , but to enter the portal with a suitcase i have seen and desired them because neither between car and car could pass or walk
<br>i as a neighbor of the center (mill fire) ) the only viable solution would be the installation of underground containers , which require a certain investment  while we will have to live with the buckets
<br>the pockets of dirt are such simply because the urban cleaning service is deficient
<br>in other cities much care is taken to clean the container areas
<br>i believe that there is no desire to make life easier for people and that does not give a vote

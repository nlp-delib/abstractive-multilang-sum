no to noises. reduce the number of decibels allowed so that dogs can be free and pee-can voted. . thank you for your proposal
<br>among all we will succeed in supporting this proposal and similar! other debates:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
<br>it is as important as the safety of a city or health for people
<br>if we have insanity in a city we run a lot of risk in all aspects
<br>the points to deal with about cleaning are quite interesting
<br>there is no need to make exaggerated investments
<br>we should propose to the city council some kind of means of awareness of the neighbors of each neighborhood so that we feel involved in maintaining those improvements that we demand
<br>i would pay 10 per month for that pet that i care for and gives me affection without doubt .
<br>i leave my vote in case it helps . scraffitti should be distinguish . areas should be created so that they can make gtaffittis and the rest should be fined for doing so so
<br>i do n't like these little girls at your house on your portal and on your car . but enough of having madrid i messed up for these little girl , not of course not
<br>the fault of the current situation of dirt in madrid is the inheritance received
<br>it is a subject with the sub-contracts with which the contracts can be terminated
<br>i urge you to support the following proposal: contracts without possibility of shielding and not beyond the legislature

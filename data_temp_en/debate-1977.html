- your approach is not uncanny, but it is unpractical.It has already been tried in other countries and only the management of all this costs more than the possible benefit to obtain.And if it is because you can sanction them, that is not a problem, you can be perfectly sanctioned and you can demand compliance with the regulations as everyone else..but demanding the registration of bicycles is a bit crazy. in countries with so many more bikes than we do, believe me is for something...
<br>- in other countries with more tradition in the use of the bike, nothing similar has been implanted... for something will be..
<br>I'm not sure, so I keep quiet, but... and compulsory insurance, who pays me in the event of an accident, and if it's not an accident?
<br>- Your mother's going to pay taxes, we're up to the balls of paying taxes so we'll have to pay a circular tax.
<br>- What if you give me a twist that falls from your balcony? and if you run me over with a shopping cart? do we make civil liability insurance compulsory to everyone? the fundamental reason why it is not mandatory for cyclists to take liability insurance, it is simply because they do not represent a sufficient risk. (statistically they do no cause so many accidents as to be considered a problem). do not look for problems where there are no such problems. that is not compulsory insurance, does not imply that cyclists, like all of us, do not have civil liability, and if a cyclist causes you any damage, of the kind that is obliged to compensate you, have or do not be insured. By the way I (who am a regular cyclist) have civil responsibility insurance as well as I have it from home but neither of the two are compulsory do we also make home insurance compulsory?.
<br>- I don't care at all, I have it very clear, if it hits me, apart from taking the worst part doesn't move until the police come, but unfortunately not everyone has it so clear with all the consequences.
<br>- you don't have to mess with anyone's mother, say your opinion without missing and that's it.
<br>- his mother doesn't pay taxes, but yours for the support he has on the due crossbow, ahhh don't forgive it takes away from having you..
<br>- and why not fine pedestrians who walk, chat, cross the bicycle lanes without any respect? they push us on the road because they are safer than the bike lanes. or that pedestrian areas are placed in the middle of each street, e.g..
<br>- Forgive me, but in holanda, paris, hamburgo,... the preference is for the bike. It is the pedestrian who has to give in. and not do it, that you take everyone's anger (cyclists, pedestrians and even motorists).
<br>- Yeah, I think they'd have to paint themselves black, see if that scares us a little...
<br>- the bike that circulates by public means is clearly a vehicle. It is the same problem as that of a few years ago the mopeds. I do not understand that 3 per year are a problem. I think like you that the bike lane must extend and protect. I don't see it incompatible with the proposal. a greeting.
<br>- it is mandatory that dogs wear chip and more than recommended for their owner who has insurance (in some breeds it is obligatory). inform yourself because it can be of great help if you have a dog know it:
<br>- the majority of people have the insurance that covers that kind of thing (gypsum, shopping cart). living in a house and having the insurance of it they usually cover this type of thing. in madrid it is true and in that I give you all the reason that cyclists do not yet represent a real danger, however the park increases exponentially and I do not think that we should wait for the problem to apply a solution that has been shown to be effective in many countries that take us a long way ahead. for the sake of the cyclist (in order to be able to pay compensation) and the protection of the pedestrian against possible leaks (which have always been heartless) is why I am speaking respectively of insurance and registration for bicycles (eye!, only for those who circulate by public way. there are already medical experts specialized in this kind of accidents (running by bicycles)
<br>- that by certain streets bicycles can be circulated with due caution, which is something that could not be done other vehicles seems normal to me, but they must be duly marked for this. That does not mean that they can circulate on the sidewalks indiscriminately, although logically, as happens with motorcycles if parked on the pavement. I think that we all agree quite on this..
<br>- the cycling lanes in my opinion should be reserved exclusively for cyclists. the opposite (like that invention of putting a pedestrian line in the bike lane itself, seems to me a fear and source of accidents. I also say that sidewalks with (except properly marked streets for this) should only be transited by pedestrians.
<br>- this is a forum of propositions and I love that there is debate, because thus among all will be achieved the best solution. regarding what I propose: the insurance is not that I am crazy or something like that. all insurance companies have it and there is even only one bicycle in Spain. the day the compensations are fired believe me that for many having spent some euros on the insurance will be worth it: no, I am not inventing anything. in some Spanish municipalities the registration and the tax is a fact:
<br>- although many of them have already ruled it out. with the mopeds it was a hit in madrid. I think that in these small municipalities it is logical that they have ruled it off. madrid I think it is different. I also don't agree that they all have to carry it. there are two speeds: for leisure, they do not circulate on public roads or if they do have a federal (sports) and/or use in transport mode. about these latter is from where I think the municipalities should intervene. anyway that will be better than a generic solution:
<br>- Thank you for all (well, almost all) your comments. They are enriching.
<br>- I would not like someone tomorrow to have a serious problem. this is like the "preferents". there were people who warned about the problem but few noticed. the best is enemy of the good, but we try to make good rules that include the protection of cyclists. being considered a vehicle when travelling by public road has some drawbacks but a thousand advantages. look, for example what will happen to this cyclist:
<br>- Sorry. The link should be this:
<br>- I read a long time ago that something like this was attempted in a Swiss city, I think, a compulsory registration / insurance for each bike, in the end the system was removed, did not compensate, it was more difficult to keep the record and all the paraphernalia than to cost the few accidents / incidents generated by cyclists.
<br>- How do you think it would have changed what the press article covers with the proposal you put forward?.
<br>- I almost got killed when I left my house at 7.30 in the morning. I spent one on a bike at full speed when I went to Adelaan to get out and it was a matter of a second not to end up in the hospital. every day you go out on the street now with the stress of not coming a bike from behind, to the one you don't hear, and it hit you. they go at all speed through the sidewalks and they care a pepper if they overwhelm you or not, they are the kings of the mambo now. By the way, my work partner has been eight months off because she was hit by a bike. Unfortunately, he couldn't report it because with all the fuss of taking her to the hospital the cyclist has vanished..
<br>- look at my answer above. you are a danger to pedestrians. read above, it could have cost me a serious inconvenience and my workmate has cost him eight months off. carrying a two-wheel machine is a having "power" that there is q know how to use and most of the q cycling on the sidewalks are lacking education and brains, but would not go at those speeds with the responsibility that involves hurting another person.
<br>- You know what's wrong? What a city councilman told me, you can't take them because they run away, to see what pedestrian can fight a cyclist... and if they've hit you less. We're totally unprotected, especially because they're protected above by the previous ones and the new ones even more..
<br>- Pablo, my mother has always paid taxes. I hope she keeps doing it for many years. We don't fall into disqualification as an argument, I beg you.
<br>- this proposal disincentives the use of the bike, which in Madrid improves mobility and does not increase pollution, so I am absolutely against it.
<br>- cyclists who circulate on the sidewalk have to be aware that the priority is the pedestrian and therefore always circulate slow, but not by brainless bandits we have to pay todxs lxs cyclists.
<br>- Good morning to all of me have been about to hit me when crossing traffic lights as pedestrians because the bikes, poor them, do not know that they should stop at the traffic light in red. on the sidewalks, they almost hit my daughter because they come at their speed, slowly according to them, but among pedestrians, which is not their site. with the car, they come out of the sidewalk and go down in the opposite direction suddenly, poor do not realize in which direction it is circulating. anyway, I agree with the proposal: they are vehicles and they want as such to be treated, because they must comply with the rules of circulation, for this they must be identified in order to be able to fine them as the other vehicles. and also contribute to the maintenance of roads like the others. and all in peace.<br>

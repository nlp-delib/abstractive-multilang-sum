- this proposal may not fall within the competence of our city council, but if you can support it to change the education system!!!.
<br>- for it seems to me a very good proposal, and that of the competences a hoax, if you want it can, and tb fix the environment etc....
<br>- It seems very good to me but I think that at an early age it may be good for children to work with books on paper better than with electronic devices because of the dangers they may have, and they may also be harmful to health.
<br>- using new technologies is ecological, why is it insane?
<br>- it can lead to vision problems mainly, in addition, the prolonged use of these devices which would imply having all the books in pdf would entail long periods of exposure to radiofrequency waves and electromagnetic fields that generate, which could cause long-term problems of the nervous system and fertility.
<br>- So you're exposed to TV?
<br>- electronic slates are implemented in many countries with very good results.
<br>- if we put ourselves like this, there are also damage problems in the vision with plastered papers, which cause uncomfortable brightness during reading. as well as loss of vision when reading conventional books with little or lots of lighting!!.
<br>- the current television led or lcd does not emit radiation, as if it were happening with old televisions or monitors of "fat ass"!!!.
<br>- Yes, the light in the reading had thought so, the letter of the books can be small and little light can blind you.
<br>- if there are free digital libraries.
<br>- Of course... computers or mobiles barely emit radiation. At first they said it produced brain cancer, but the technique changes, I say, that I don't know.
<br>- digital books in pdf and digital boards to see pdfs. wonderful.
<br>- by experience, not all children and adolescents adapt to the electronic format. I think that it is still a little (and I emphasize a little) soon to establish the digital format by law. still, is it the competence of the city council a measure like the proposal?.
<br>- the school books in pdf seems to me a good proposal, it would even allow the power to update them without having to be buying new books every year simply because they have changed four paragraphs compared to last year. although of course, that to the editorials will not be very funny because they will be spoiled the business of selling the same book to you again and again, simply changing the layout and little more.
<br>- javier... you have given the target!!! the editorials won't be very funny, although they will continue to model and make books because with my proposal we eliminate only the printing on paper. the other steps will remain in effect, but I hope that with a substantial reduction of costs... I hope!!!.
<br>- there are scientific studies that show that the learning process in children is best done using paper-based books compared to electronic formats.
<br>- I, from my own experience, see that children are born more and more skilled to handle mobiles and tablets. with year and little they get into youtube and put their cartoon videos!!!.
<br>- because the human brain is prepared for interactivity, but that doesn't imply learning.
<br>- expand the network and access to the internet and minimize paper books, yes, but eliminate them, no, because the network is private and there are no absolute guarantees of impartiality and equality in access. Neither is there equality in the resources that each family has, it is now and the editorial network does not always work the same... please as the saying "do not put all eggs in the same basket"<br>

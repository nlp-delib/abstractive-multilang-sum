<br>pedestrian areas placed in the middle of each street, forgive me, but in holanda, paris, hamburgo,... the preference is for the bike. .
<br>they push us on the road because they are safer .
<br>they'd i think they'd have to paint themselves black, see if that scares us a little... the bike that circulates by public means is clearly a

<br>not do it, that you take everyone's anger (cyclists, pedestrians .the opposite (like that putting a pedestrian line in the bike lane itself, seems to me a fear and source of accidents. .
<br>the day the compensations are fired believe me that for many having spent euros on the insurance will be worth it: no, i am not inventing .

 I keep quiet, but... and compulsory insurance, who pays me in the event of an accident, and if it's not an accident? Your mother's going to pay taxes, we're up to the balls of paying taxes so we'll have to pay a circular tax. What if you run me over with a shopping cart? do we make civil liability insurance compulsory to everyone? if cyclists
<br> I do not understand that 3 per year are a problem. I think like you that the bike lane must extend and protect. a greeting. it is mandatory that dogs wear chip and more than recommended for their owner who has insurance of it they usually cover this type of thing (gypsum, shopping cart). in madrid it is true and in that I give you all the reason that cyclists do not yet represent
<br> the insurance is not that I am crazy or something like that. in some Spanish municipalities the registration and the tax is a fact. although many of them have already ruled it out. with the mopeds it was a hit in madrid. I also don't agree that they all have to carry it. about these latter is from where I think the municipalities should intervene. anyway that will be better than a
<br> cyclists, they are the kings of the mambo now. lxs cyclists.. read above, it could have cost me a serious inconvenience and my workmate has cost him eight months off because he was hit by a bike.. look at my answer above.. Pablo, my mother has always paid taxes. I hope she keeps doing it for many years. This proposal disincentives

It has already been tried in other countries and only the management of all this costs more than the possible benefit to obtain. The fundamental reason why it is not mandatory for cyclists to take liability insurance, it is simply because they do not represent a sufficient risk. that is not compulsory insurance, does not imply that cyclists, like all of us, do not have civil liability.
<br>It is the same problem as that of a few years ago the mopeds. I do not understand that 3 per year are a problem. I think like you that the bike lane must extend and protect. It is mandatory that dogs wear chip and more than recommended for their owner who has insurance (in some breeds it is obligatory)
<br>I would not like someone tomorrow to have a serious problem, this is like the "preferents". there were people who warned about the problem but few noticed. the best is enemy of the good, but we try to make good rules that include the protection of cyclists. being considered a vehicle when travelling by public road has some drawbacks but a thousand advantages.
<br>I almost got killed when I left my house at 7.30 in the morning. I spent one on a bike at full speed when I went to Adelaan to get out and it was a matter of a second not to end up in the hospital. every day you go out on the street now with the stress of not coming a bike from behind. They go at all speed through the sidewalks and they care a pepper if they overwhelm you or not.

your approach is not uncanny , but it has already been tried in other countries and only the management of all this costs more than the possible benefit to obtain
<br>you can be perfectly sanctioned and you can demand compliance with the regulations as everyone else

<br>it is mandatory that dogs wear chip and more than recommended for their owner who has insurance
<br>the majority of people have the insurance that covers that kind of thing (gypsum, shopping cart) ) living in a house and having the insurance of it they usually cover this type of thing
<br>in madrid it is true and in that i give you all the reason that cyclists do not yet represent a real danger
<br>in some spanish municipalities the registration and the tax is a fact

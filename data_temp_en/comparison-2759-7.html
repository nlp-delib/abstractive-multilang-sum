<br>  the keys are circular through the center of the car so that they do not pass by spraying and have to use the adjacent lane if they want to advance you, look for quiet streets (like the streets of a single lane for a sense, in which a bike can go at more speed than the car can, because of space) and always respect the rules of traffic.if you want to try, throw a bug on the page or

I do not see it sensible, is to move the fear of the cyclist by the car, to the pedestrian by the bicycle. I like your encouragement to use the road, I also encourage everyone since it is the best way to be safer. The sidewalks for pedestrians and roads better share them with cars (with or without separation)
<br>I think the problem is that cyclists in many cases believe that they are the kings of circulation. I think that the minimum width so that they can circulate bicycles on the sidewalk is 3 meters. I support the proposal for a real regulation of light electric vehicles. We are already more than 3,000 supporters of this proposal.

it is a very sensible proposal but it seems to me that the solution is to gain space to the car
<br>i would be more in favour of lane-bikes on the road , perhaps protected to ensure that the cars do not invade it
<br>and at a certain distance from the parked cars (because of the danger of opening a door).on the other hand
<br>i mean wide sidewalks and always with priority for the pedestrian
<br>it would be in places where these lanes do not exist
<br>i support the proposal and ask for another who asks for a safe bike lane network for all madrid

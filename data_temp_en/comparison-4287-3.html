 incivism. For the debate, what is worse is a cyclist who jumps a traffic light when no-one comes on the road that crosses or a pedestrian crosses a street in red when no one comes and/or without pedestrians? a purpose of traffic rules, is to avoid accidents. which skip them can be due to several reasons, may lack traffic lights and when having to move away it crosses improper
<br> bikes can never go on the sidewalk, but please, the first thing we start to impose fines to offenders who run around where they want to go without respecting the rules of movement. they respect nothing or anyone. they have to run along the road and comply with the regulations of movement like everyone else. bicycles must respect traffic rules because they are vehicles, vulnerable, but vehicles and more vulnerable are still pedestrians..
<br> there are no cops to regulate it, and they go a fashion.I drive a bike, but also a car and a motorcycle.The traffic rules are clear and include bicycles.They are vehicles and they are forbidden to travel along the sidewalks.Is it so difficult to understand?. Mobility officers and the municipal police should ensure to avoid the incivic behaviors of all those who skip the rules.

<br>cyclists can record 365 days of the year to different cyclists committing various violations .bicycles must respect traffic rules because they are vehicles, vulnerable, but vehicles and more vulnerable .
<br>many other car drivers do not respect the rules of traffic (non-signal etc.) etc.) .
<br>cyclists speak of 9 out of 10 cars that i have seen with my own eyes do not go to 30 km/h or 50km/hr, of course to protect. pedestrians .
<br>nor should we generalize .he says bikes can share sidewalks with pedestrians .
<br>a car and a motorcycle.the traffic rules are not "more for one than for another".they .
<br>the worst is that the municipal police never intervene. .
<br>i believe that with good intention the two can live .<br>

- Depends on the time. Those of us who sleep in front of the park the games of some are annoying of others. Sleep is a right.
<br>- against totally, the parks will enjoy something scarce in the city, the silence and the soft noise of nature. selfish posture ruining a person the enjoyment of an entire park, not to mention the noise-sensitive animals, such as birds, that would suffer with drums.
<br>- that's your opinion, but there are people we think about differently.Do you know what noise pollution is?Do you realize that near parks and public roads there are homes? Do you know that exposure to unwanted sounds has very harmful effects on health?Do You like that they touch percussion near you when you need to rest?Silence is the scarcest good that exists today.We must protect it.
<br>- if the city council had set you up a park 15 meters from your bedroom like me, you'd already tell me the energy you get up the next day.
<br>- solution: at regulated hours, at night prohibited.
<br>- the percussion is not noise, it's music. the noise is it of traffic. so selfish is to want to use only the park to hear the birds or the silence, how apart from that to enjoy a good moment of music. in a park there is space for everyone. who wants music, gets close to musicians, who wants birds comes close to birds...the parks must be a place for all.
<br>- the percussion is music is not noise. the noise is produced by traffic, let's all fight against the brutal noise of traffic. but fighting against music and art seems very wrong to me. it can be played on a regular schedule, at the forbidden night.
<br>- solution: at regulated hours, at night prohibited.
<br>- if you read my comment carefully you will see that I have not used the word "noise".I believe that a park is a place where many want to enjoy the sounds of nature and also, if possible, some silence.When I want to listen to music I go to a suitable place.If we play music on the street we can disturb many travellers and neighbors who at that time do not want to hear it; there are people who work at night and have to rest during the day or simply want to have a reading.I totally agree that traffic is the biggest cause of noise in the city, but it is not the only one, in fact many pedestrian areas are among the loudest.
<br>- sometimes the sound of music is so high that it nullifies all the other sounds that may be in a park; other times, when luckily the park is very large, it is necessary to get away many hundreds of meters from the focus of the music to stop hearing it. are not equivalent sounds.
<br>- we don't all have the same hours or circumstances; there are people who work at night and need to rest during the day.
<br>- horrific proposal, the so many have place in the jungle, not in a park where you will disconnect and enjoy the silence.The retreat was insufferable to the neighbors.
<br>- little they did to you for what you were upset about. Not to mention the drug trapping between the drums.
<br>- against. Don't you see that I cognac is going through the park and wanting to be trankilo and that there are 4 cafres playing drums that nobody likes. if you want to play the bongo or anything else do in your house if your neighbors allow you.
<br>- daindonor, you're the one you run away from music, but many others get close. there will be something to distribute space for everyone. you and others like you, you want to impose the dictatorship of 0 music in parks and that's not fair. a lot of people enjoy and enjoy the music in the parks, so this is done all over the planet, and I think what madrid is of the few cities in the world that have banned percussion in parks. I repeat there'll be what to distribute parks for everyone, the park of retreat, is wide enough for there to be a place for everybody.
<br>- donandor will have to adapt to most, and most sleep at night.
<br>- donator meant that the percussion is not "acoustic pollution", "acoustic contamination" is produced by cars, planes, people who scream....
<br>- I don't run away from music, I assure you that I love it, but I do not want to hear it every hour and anywhere.In madrid there are some very large parks, like the retreat, but there are also many small parks where making music would imply forcing everyone to listen to it, whether we want it or not, and that's not fair either.
<br>- it wouldn't be at all hours or anywhere. it would be on a regulated schedule and in large parks like the retreat.
<br>- I have seen that you have changed your original proposal and now you limit it to withdrawal; although I still do not like the idea, it seems more reasonable to me, although I think that, if it were to be done, it should be well regulated to cause the least inconvenience.I have also been reading other proposals you have made, seem good in general, I am sorry to disagree with this in particular.Thank you for responding to all my comments.
<br>- I am glad that now you like the proposal more, which for reasons of space limitation I cannot express more extensively. I also think it is good that you like other proposals that I have submitted. respond to your comments and those of others, for me it is a pleasure.
<br>- more comments than support, and almost all of the author of the thread. with a link to other proposals of the same. translated: spam..
<br>- Most people think you're making noise. We'll have to adapt and accept it.
<br>- then they'll put a full-volume percussion battery under your window on your street. You'll see what I like.
<br>- I'll leave you this proposal in case you're interested.<br>

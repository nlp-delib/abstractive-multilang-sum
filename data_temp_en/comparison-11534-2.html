 if there are free digital libraries. Of course... computers and mobiles barely emit radiation. At first they said it produced brain cancer, but the technique changes, that I don't know. digital books in pdf and digital boards to see pdfs. wonderful. I think that at an early age it may be good for children to work with books on paper better than with electronic devices because of the dangers they may have, and
<br> the editorials will be very funny, although they will continue to model and make books because with my proposal we eliminate only the printing on paper. the other steps will remain in effect, but I hope that with a substantial reduction of costs... I hope!!!. the school books in pdf seems to me a good proposal, it would even allow the power to update them without having to be buying new books every year simply because they have

<br> law. still, is the competence of the city council a measure like the proposal?. school books . 
<br>  it would even allow the power to update them without having to be buying new books every year simply because they have changed four paragraphs compared to last year. although of course, that to the editorials will not be very funny . 
<br>  I hope that with a substantial reduction of costs... I there are scientific studies that show that the learning process in children is best done using paper-based books .

I think that at an early age it may be good for children to work with books on paper better than with electronic devices because of the dangers they may have, and they may also be harmful to health. This proposal may not fall within the competence of our city council, but if you can support it to change the education system!!!.
<br>I think that it is still a little (and I emphasize a little) soon to establish the digital format by law. by experience, not all children and adolescents adapt to the electronic format. with year and little they get into youtube and put their cartoon videos!!!. because the human brain is prepared for interactivity, but that doesn't imply learning.

<br>but if you can support it to change the education system and that of the competences a hoax
<br>the prolonged use of these devices would entail long periods of exposure to radiofrequency waves and electromagnetic fields that generate, which could cause long-term problems of the nervous system and fertility
<br>by experience , not all children and adolescents adapt to the electronic format
<br>it would even allow the power to update them without having to be buying new books every year

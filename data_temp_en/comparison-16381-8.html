even more, should be applied to the whole district or neighborhood, .
<br>the measure is not the same as a city as a madrid city .
<br>urbanism forces us to have a garbage room, with which i retire. and now wants to put common cubes on the street, focus of plagues, dirt and smells...
<br>i don't know what we should do is stop generating so much garbage, and learn to recycle .truck : the yellow ones did not exist... regarding the garbage room, it will be mandatory .
<br>another matter is a garbage room and now it bothers him to go out to throw it away.. if with the aesthetics of a town compared to all. .
<br>there : there are many areas in our city that there have always been fixed community containers on the street, or in san blas .
<br>it, has never been a problem 56 years old, it .the cubes remain out for many hours, as in many other streets of this morning .
<br>it : we do not put so many problems, we can approach the containers without suffering, .
<br>can expand information on collection systems ''
<br>neighbors : we have always taken the garbage for ourselves, and less directly from our door. .the difference between small and large containers is an improvement towards energy efficiency, .
<br>the pneumatic collection that exposes me good, inform yourself of the changes, the works and the cost with which it would lead to it in a city like madrid, .
<br>the small containers of most neighborhoods pass on the street an average of 12 .
<br>progress is not based on their comfort, have or not a quarter of garbage, .<br>

 a village, I think it is obvious. hello, according to the proposal, even more, should be applied to the whole district or neighborhood, greetings. I have nothing against the people, I don't know what you have against the villages... what we should do is stop generating so much garbage, and learn to recycle better. greetings, thanks for the proposal. I assure you that if the measure is carried
<br> they are not the focus of plagues, neither dirt, nor odors, that after all we are the ones who throw the trash, not the city.. because instead of moving forward in those neighborhoods with hydraulic collection systems, I think it's called the one that through pipes goes straight to collectors, or more modern ones, we take steps back. It's anti-aesthetic, besides much less
<br> to walk a little bit, but don t defend the indefensible or deny the obvious, please. I haven't run out of arguments, but I think that with the data are more than enough and what I don't want to waste much time with someone who according to their reality we must live in the nineteenth century p.e. worsening the hygiene, health and aesthetic
<br> if you like it so much, go to a village and live in all its intensity the delay that you like so much and stop disqualifying and say assholes. I am oly passing from preaching in the desert, and now you have started to insult directly. my house is very clean, thank you. it speaks of the dirt they accumulate, can complain to the ayto, I have

I was superconscious about recycling for 20 years, but seeing as how the matter is becoming and how the town hall treats us, we are taken away from it. Neither the population, the one that generates waste, nor the aesthetics of the city have anything to do with it. urbanism forces us to have a garbage room, with which I very much agree for hygiene, aesthetics and smells.
<br>In front of my house they take out 4 of the oranges and 3 of the yellows daily, from 17:00 until 8 a.m. the next day. another thing is that in their urbanization there is a garbage room and now it bothers him to go out to throw it away. because 15 years ago we had to walk a lot to find a cardboard recycling container, for example, because the yellow ones did not exist.
<br>I don't make up stories or it's the end of the world to walk a little bit, but don't defend the indefensible or deny the obvious, please. my community of neighbors, which also exceeds fifty, is one more example, on the whole street the cubes remain out for many hours, as in many other streets of this city. I will put in your knowledge a data, waiting for it not to be frightened.
<br>Small and large containers is an improvement towards energy efficiency, and an improvement in acoustic pollution since it makes much less stops. do not worsen hygiene, health or aesthetics because the small containers of most neighborhoods pass on the street an average of 12 hours. regarding the pneumatic collection that it exposes seems to me good, inform yourself of the changes.

<br>has not given any weighty argument

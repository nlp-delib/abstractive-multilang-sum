 agree. There is technically possible, and at almost the same price (less than 5 euros extra . 
<br>  it is not important but the health of the small people is fundamental and with that you do not play or bargain: we are what we eat.. is a very appropriate and intelligent measure from many points of view: . 
<br> the food only costs 1 euro per day and the rest is taken by the staff of the dining and care.. a school can have its own kitchen or bring food from outside . 
<br>  if one takes his own food to eat there the price is almost equal, 3.5 euros! .

 only need will. it is not important, but it is absolutely necessary. to educate the most small people in responsible consumption, local, sustainable, etc. should be one of the main tasks, but the one that most. we will get it. thank you very much promoters. What luck. What school was it? What luck? What school did it? what luck? How luck. How lucky. What schools were it?
<br> we love them close. I offer you another way to generate employment and help families without resources. Considering that in Madrid, independent food banks operate have only 4 employees and 450 volunteers, the creation of a municipally run and public food bank would generate an environment number of 500 jobs for the coordination of the collection, storage and delivery of food to families with no resources. the proposal is interesting but I fear that we are forgetting

<br>the public children's school "the sun" of chamantin has an ecological menu, .
<br>it is technically possible, and at almost the same price (less than 5 euros extra .
<br>there was no child who know where the food came .
<br>in his school, when they were little (because they had a garden .the bodies of municipal ownership follow ecological criteria, proximity and social economy .
<br>in my daughter's public school the price for being in the dining room is more or less 4.5 euros, .
<br>the food only costs 1 euro per day and the rest is taken by the staff of the dining and care.. a school can have its own kitchen or bring food .

I remember that in my school, when we were little (because then they took it off) we had a garden and we ate what we grew. There was no child who didn't know where the food came from. There is no right to be paid real fortunes for the meals of our children and/or elders.

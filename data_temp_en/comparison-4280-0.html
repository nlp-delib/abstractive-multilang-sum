to receive a parking card it is necessary to first have a recognized degree of disability
<br>there are many people who ca n't drive because of their physical condition or simply because they do not know but if they need to move by car and others help them
<br>i do n't understand the reason for this proposal if in principle i think it is contemplating . i am in favour of measures being taken to reduce pollution . but we need to go to our medical consultations and treatments in madrid

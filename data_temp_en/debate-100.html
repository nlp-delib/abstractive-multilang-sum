<br>- it would be interesting to put "multiples" on the one who really does, because we are not going to pay all those who destroy it, and surely with it we would pay less taxes.
<br>- I support your proposal. Most madrid neighborhoods are in the same state.
<br>- Good morning to all, cleaning is one of the parts of a society that we have to take care of all without exception, it is as important as the safety of a city or health for people, if we have insanity in a city we run a lot of risk in all aspects, I send you a link so that you enter to read it if you think it is correct to vote it, the points to deal with about cleaning are quite interesting, there is no need to make exaggerated investments, but, all this is over-proven and works, vote the idea if you like to get as many votes as possible in order to be able to react to the cleaning of madrid.
<br>- I support cleaning, but I like graffiti, I don't see anything unhygienic about it.
<br>- in fact, we're not against the graffiti, we are against the "painted without meaning".Artistic graffiti do have room, vandalism doesn't.
<br>- It seems to me a very interesting proposal. Neighbors by a meter in the area of the streets the yebens, shrimp and valmojado.
<br>- totally agree.
<br>- voted like you did with mine.
<br>- voted. more than fines that they won't be able to pay would make them perform community cleaning services... to clean dog poops, gums and glues on bus stops and stations! so they take a little bit of consciousness. and for graffiti that are art restoration of walls in solar and public places where to show their skill.
<br>- voted. I agree above all that the neighborhood needs improvements in some streets and sidewalks and the theme of cleaning and containers. the only thing I disagree is on the subject of graffiti, I am well made I like, urban art.
<br>- something that I think would greatly benefit the city's cleanup is the increase in sidewalk cleaning machines of those that are a small vehicle like those of machines cleaning cars with brushes, water and soap. How many machines of these there is running on madrid?, with how big it is you would have to see many and almost don't see and the ones I see are environmental, but aren't those the ones that look after the parks? there should be in every district a whole legion of them working, is the way to have the city clean and hygienic, because here it doesn't rain just as it can be in the north.
<br>- voted partner!.
<br>- I'm sorry, but graffiti, none. I don't have to like to see my facade painted with something I haven't chosen. I prefer to see the streets with clean facades as they were conceived when they were built.
<br>- not only for rent but for all the neighborhoods that suffer from these problems, so I support your proposal but also refer to the neighborhoods of the center, specifically that of malaish..
<br>- we should propose to the city council some kind of means of awareness of the neighbors of each neighborhood so that we feel involved in maintaining those improvements that we demand. cleaning, not noise, and what is in our hands.
<br>- I know the area and I agree but I agree more with putting a fee for the pets, with the payment of the same would deliver a plan with the areas reserved for the dogs, an extract of the regulations, courses, basic care, etc. this implies more responsibility for the owner and would increase the formation and knowledge of the regulation so unknown by the current owners and walkers no longer would be a free toy as until now. what does not cost is not valued. I would pay 10 per month for that pet that I care for and gives me affection without doubt.
<br>- voted. You have to take care of all neighborhoods equally, as well as rent, vallecas is being taken by drug addicts and camels. please support my proposal
<br>- supported! and spread to the rest of the neighborhoods.
<br>- I know a lease and it's true that it looks "old" and dirty. I leave my vote in case it helps.
<br>- Scraffitti should be differentiated. Areas should be created so that they can make gtaffittis and the rest should be fined for doing so.
<br>- in madrid urban art little and vandalism a lot... take a walk through the center of madrid...vomitive, historic buildings, urban real estate, portal doors, escapades with acid painted....zero tolerance to graffiti.
<br>- if you like them at your house on your portal and on your car... but enough of having madrid I fuck up for these little girls.
<br>- not of course not, but on walls that are not used (or used for advertising) yes.
<br>- I agree with you, but we have to bear in mind that all the work is not of the city council, also with regard to educating us in respect for others and for citizenship and raising the awareness of people that the street is not the town council but of all of us and for that reason we must take care of it and respect it. the freedom of others ends where mine begins. and if it is not achieved by the good, it would be, best, then fine the chant..
<br>- esteemed neighbor, as you will know, the fault of the current situation of dirt in madrid is the inheritance received (and not precisely of shoemaker).The cleaning contracts were armored in the previous legislature, and, even if they want to terminate such contracts due to clear non-compliance, it cannot be.It is not a thing of the ayto, it is a subject with the sub-contracts with which the contracts cannot be terminated.to prevent something like this from happening again (government who governs), I encourage you to support the following proposal: contracts without possibility of shielding and not beyond the legislature. (61 support)
<br>- same contract, more dirt. That's no excuse.
<br>- I insist, it is the same contract, because it cannot be terminated, this armored. the legal services of the ayto were seeing the contract and this armoured even, after the legislature, I don't know what part I do not understand. they could come perfectly to do the cleaning, the ready ones that signed that mortgage.
<br>- It's not my first choice, but yes, the smart guys had the cleanest city with the same contract, so I'd rather you go back to following these bad managers.
<br>- Yes, yes, much cleaner, whatever you say.
<br>- Well, that's it.

<br>- as far as graffiti is concerned... there is something I agree that perhaps there are more than desirable and not precisely in the most "suitable" and/or "opportune" sites (if there is any place that can be considered suitable for this).Here he left a proposal to perhaps minimize the impact of graffiti on inappropriate sites (I insist, if you can consider any suitable place, that I do not affirm). graffiti-free motherrid. (301 supports)
<br>- the lack of civicism that this society has created is intolerable, there cannot be a sweeper cleaning up the same street again and again on the same day, we have to clean up agreeable, but we must end this impunity for people who leave garbage bags, bottles, furniture, mattresses, cardboard, dog poops, etc.... anywhere, without that page until they learn that the city is the heritage of all and as citizens we deserve a respect. that the regulations apply and that the offender is fined.
<br>- supported. I'll leave you this petition in case it suits you and you could help us, the neighborhood is very, very, dirty. thank you.
<br>- Congratulations on the proposal! in the neighborhood of castles we have a "park" with the mimoso problems. we thank you very much if you read and support our proposal<br>

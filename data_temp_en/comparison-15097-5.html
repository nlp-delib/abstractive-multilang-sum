 the city council can save money. without taking personal, they can hire more to collect what is deposited in shopping malls. it is for convenience. if it is recycled more, it is good for madrid. moreover, the ccs can save costs. in brick there is currently one of electrical material, batteries and bulbs and ** is filled to overflow** every week and they leave things on the ground because
<br> if you do it for money or for conviction.. I see it as an incentive too, so people will be interested and in the future will be a custom acquired, that is done more by the fact of contributing to the environment than by the money received!. I think that in the end we have to recycle by conscience to be civic and educate, on the contrary to fine the one who does not, especially if they

 convenience. I would propose to clean points in the ccs because for them it is good for people to take it to the clean spot and I am in favour of that if there is a pattern and the result is good, you have to support it . 
<br>  the city council can save costs. without taking personal, they can extend the hours of the municipal staff or hire more to collect what is deposited in shopping malls. . 
<br> douglas rushkoff : (and I call for support for proposal to reduce noise pollution. . 
<br>  he says it 's a city more or less like madrid. I very much agree with proposal . 
<br>  he says you recycle as much as possible. It matter if you do it for money .

i do not think it 's a profit to recycle and to recover the cost of that packaging that we were previously charged when we purchased it
<br>the solution is called returnable containers , especially for glass bottles . when you return them to the machine they return the price of the helmet
<br>it is done in almost all of europe , and in spain it was done also decades ago
<br>if you give an incentive as small as it is , even if you cover it at the supermarket , people keep it at home and return it to the establishment with its 20 or 30 cents per pack
<br>this happens in many countries of europe and also if you leave it on the street
<br>there are people need to get a performance to those bottles and also for the sake of cleaning the streets

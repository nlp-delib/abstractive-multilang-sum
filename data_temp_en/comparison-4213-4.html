Bikes that go along the sidewalks or off the bike lanes should be sanctioned. The real danger is in the night hours, in which many cyclists go without any light. Not everyone goes with headphones, not everyone jumps the traffic lights, and cars have to settle for the presence of bikes. It's one more means of transport, and it deserves respect.

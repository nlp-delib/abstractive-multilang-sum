it 's not a bad idea but how to do it
<br>you'd have to put special trucks that pick up garbage on the portal and take them to the subway
<br>the first would be to promote the concept near the subway mouths with elevators
<br>other subway operators could lower the cubes at night and wait for the car enabled to pass to transport the garbage cubes
<br>in fact that the problem of containers is that they are collected with little assiduousness
<br>in principle the collection of garbage would be made in night hours with what the users of the metro and the containers would not cross
<br>the bags would be paid with advertising . in this way we ensure that the problems of health are a little more controlled
<br>the people with reduced mobility hate the current cubes (impossible to open) the glass-collected domes with the mouth so high
<br>in germany the town hall regales the yellow bags for the recycling of containers
<br>on the municipal council there is a piece of furniture from where you can take a roll of bags per person
<br>since you say that we would end up with the bad smells on the street
<br>the containers would have to be sealed before entering the metro
<br>and disinfected on the outside (both in terms of sanitary and odours) )
<br>i say that the idea is interesting, if the metro is not used to transport some kind of goods
<br>and we build on the surface a network of trams or trolleybuses or floating trains
<br>for people and cars we leave them out of the city in strategic parking lots
<br>i like that you like it . the idea is not to take a walk to take the garbage
<br>it seems to me very ingenious! that the collection and transport of the garbage is done in the basement
<br>but we would also not have to rule out that , instead of doing it in the subway cars
<br>with this voting system on this web we do n't get the 54,000 support or pussy....................................................................................................................
<br>i agree , and it 's a shame you do n't have enough reception
<br>i do n't see the difficulty of lowering the garbage cans from the street to a platform in an elevator , putting it in a wagon at 3 in the morning
<br>it 's the first time that it was possible to do it and in an ideal world it happened more often

 a special exit, and then in destination the same thing.. equal if... the idea could be carried out in phases. the first would be to promote the concept near the subway mouths with elevators. you would have to make special (vertical) accesses on the subway for garbage containers and take them to the subway..
<br> the bags to pick up dog poop should give up the others, because... people save on that, and the truth, it didn't fall on it. The idea is that: 1) the bags are small enough for the daily garbage and so do not store more than necessary at home2) have no cost to the user3) close in a more efficient way than a shopping bag... (some shops hole the bags in the
<br> garbage. If it is already hot in summer that doesn't hold, imagine sharing tunnels with wagons carrying garbage. the garbage would be collected and transported in the hours that the subway network was closed if many. consider it a complementary proposal to the current system, since not everyone has a subway mouth nearby. for the topic of heat I have no proposal. even if they are not shared, the smell remains very
<br> cars? (the only reason is the cars that occupy most of the streets) and trucks? a greeting!. indeed, that is what I would like to hear. more ideas! in positive! with solutions! A greeting neighbors!. I am sure that if you keep going around it can be a good solution. pd.cleaning workers who are going to run out of work won't be 
<br> t matter, neither the lady bottle, nor the lady carmena nor... ines savanes... they pay attention, it is third worldist, but through their homes they do not spend the night collecting garbage. I haven't located the changes. In the virtues area it is assumed that it is a substitute service. I've been reading all the notes you've provided, and I
<br> a chasque that a politician presents himself to respond to citizens. ines savanes is political. encourage and plant it for participatory budgets. we better do it by plane, it's cooler. It's the first time that it was possible to do it and in an ideal world it happened more often, but for something it starts. I am sure that it is impossible to reach the 54

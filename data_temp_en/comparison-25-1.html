I remember that in my school, when we were little (because then they took it off) we had a garden and we ate what we grew. There was no child who didn't know where the food came from. There is no right to be paid real fortunes for the meals of our children and/or elders.
<br>Poverty and exclusion in Spain have increased alarmingly in recent years. Inequality in Spain is advancing at a rate that exceeds 14 times to Greece. 13.4 million people at risk of exclusion in 2014 (29.2% of the Spanish population) as the report "an economy serving 1%" made public in 2016 by Oxfam.

 agree. There is technically possible, and at almost the same price (less than 5 euros extra . 
<br>  it is not important but the health of the small people is fundamental and with that you do not play or bargain: we are what we eat.. is a very appropriate and intelligent measure from many points of view: . 
<br> the food only costs 1 euro per day and the rest is taken by the staff of the dining and care.. a school can have its own kitchen or bring food from outside . 
<br>  if one takes his own food to eat there the price is almost equal, 3.5 euros! .

 totally agree. there is no right to be paid real fortunes for the meals of our children and/or elders . 
<br>  food mess, nutritionally incomplete and whose benefit only affects the turn contract, rather than the health of those who have to eat it. I remember that in my school, when we were little (because then they took it off) we had a garden . 
<br> totally in agreement that the bodies of municipal ownership follow ecological criteria, proximity and social economy in their public purchases in the services of school dining in children's schools . 
<br>  the food only costs 1 euro per day and the rest is taken by the staff of the dining and care.. a school can have its own kitchen or bring food from outside .

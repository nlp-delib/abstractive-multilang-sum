 I don ́t want to flag the bull, nor kill it that is where the bull suffers, if you give it a cap and send the boy to the bull nothing happens, . 
<br>  don ́t agree with the same, who do not go, respect those who like. that I would eliminate death in the bull's square and flag all over and sting, . 
<br> the bull does not mean that it is done, too, since now no one eats meat of any kind because it has been decided by the fact the animal cannot be killed and less suffer, please.I tell you that I understand it as suffering and not as blood. suffering .

I would eliminate death in the bull's square and flag all over and sting, and that he would be bullied as much as he wanted and then put himself in the corral again. I respect everything that I don't like as long as no damage is done. I just can't agree to hire snipers and I just don't want to hire them myself.
<br>I'm a vegetarian but even if I wasn't, it has nothing to do with killing to eat (and I say killing, that I didn't have to torture) than killing or not killing and just torturing for fun or because I am having a good time. There's a lot of pain between animals because of our hand, even to eat? of course, and it's something that needs to be eradicated.

<br>  there are certain people influenced by Catalans who want to end everything that represents Spanish or Spanish . 
<br>  I savages are the respect that is due to every living being? the hobby of bulls . 
<br> the bull does not mean that it is done, too, since now no one eats meat of any kind because it has been decided by the fact that the animal cannot be killed and less suffer, please.I tell you . 
<br>  if I agree on the suffering of the bull must not exist, but not that they want it all to suffer. .

<br>i would leave the bulls but without any kind of suffering for the animal , but there are people who reason is not in their head and think either
<br>but you eat meat, and chickens and turkeys, and calves and other animals, right
<br>one option is to be vegan and if not, you are contributing to the sacrifice of animals, suffering and becoming saved with them
<br>the one who does n't see it as the bull does not mean that it is done, too
<br>i advise you to review the dictionary

 street art. madrid free of paints that the money spent on cleaning them would be better used in social works.. you can give them guidelines to paint and not, it is something that they are doing many shops in their locks and doors . 
<br>  I insist that I speak of public areas, such as the walls under the bridges of roads, that are full of painted and could be improved, or facades of ruined buildings, . 
<br> I think that the only solution to the painted ones is in the long term and it is about "education in respect", the rest are only momentary. cleaning, costed with money either public or of each neighbor, until another enlightened one who thinks he is a great creative and condemns us to see his "art". what some shops do, paying for them to paint their closures .

<br> I is a pity that you can not attach photos in the proposals because it is really worth seeing them, but I have attached the location of an institute in my neighbourhood . 
<br>  the change is brutal, now the facades of the schools and nurseries have motivating drawings and phrases. and some walls have yielded to associations to decorate them every x time .

If you leave specific spaces so that the graffiti painters paint is worth me, but that paint where they want not, that then we are the owners of the real estate that we have to clean the wreckage. who decides if a painted is beautiful or artistic? to me may not like (in fact most are a horror). graffiti are vandalistic acts that want to sell us as street art.

<br>In my neighborhood, vallecas villa, they are already doing it and the change is brutal. I like the painted ones in the buildings, however "motivating" they are for some. The only permissible space for the shrimps called "graphiters" to paint, is their own house.

<br>the intention is not to have to spend money on cleaning painted and have fewer areas that are either a horror or that are simply a signature

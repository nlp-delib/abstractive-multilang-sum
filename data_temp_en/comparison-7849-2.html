 a zebra step with the traffic light of the pedestrians passing in green for them, or another example that you can put to you is when a cyclist walks so slowly because they are hanging from the mobile while writing, or infinity of things more, it distracts a lot more, so much so that on many occasions and seen pedestrians that they are almost hit by looking at the mobile as they pass through 
<br> pedestrians are not allowed to use the bike lane in madrid, except for those under 16 years old. wear reflective if it is mandatory at night....it doesn't make sense not to wear them. monetary penalty also do not understand that many people still have to learn to use these tools that the new city council gives us, but to use it correctly we have to take into account 2 things/rules/
<br> the cyclist, you will tell me why? because it is a problem of ordinances not of the user, which will understand if you kill yourself because you do not wear the helmet or take it forward because you are not visible, the lights are not mandatory with little visibility, and the helmet is mandatory for minors, the reflectant, the light is not mandatory, because in general, I repeat that I am not talking about
<br> the other way around. I am not a supporter of bicycles in madrid, but I consider that the relationship is one that allows not to use the helmet to cyclists, provided that the basic traffic rules are met.this is not the pub where it is summertime but a vertiginous, convulsive city.I have not said that the traffic order is wrong, but it seems appropriate and follows
<br> a bicycle does not have half the danger of a car, a motorcycle, or a truck, and less driven by a 3-year-old child with a bike, if we're going to put those examples, I can tell you that a woman in the palm of madrid who has driven in the opposite direction for 2 kilometers or taxi drivers, bus drivers or truck drivers who do not respect the

 if you speak for the whatapp, that when you are talking to someone, or infinity of things more, it distracts a lot more, so much so that on many occasions . 
<br>  a cyclist is more distracted or any qualifier you want to put us on, it's not true, because it goes a thousand times more pending than a pedestrian . 
<br> I have n't talked about distracted, a pedestrian on the sidewalk can go as distracted as he wants if he hits someone is at 5 km/h . 
<br>  the new city council gives us, but to use it correctly we have to take into account 2 things/rules/standards that are pure logic and coherence:1-do not repeat proposals please, . 
<br> the mobility ordinance fails to comply with the greater but all the rules, like not stopping in groups to speak, run, jump or do any kind of act . 
<br>  the biggest offender is not the cyclist; only for a few who do the goat you already get us all, when we do not even half of the nonsense . 
<br> the cyclists that you comment, are foreigners who use the electric bicycles of the madrid community, or people who wear walking bikes or have been riding on it for a very short time, have to go on the road . 
<br>  I am also a favourer of coexistence and respect to which you do not feel the same, but the principle of an agreement is that they are not discriminated positively in terms of traffic rules. I . 
<br> madrid is a city for bicycles, for its orography and influx of citizens . 
<br>  it is removed a lane to change it by bicycle only separated from the traffic and pedestrians, so the coexistence is improved, apart from that it should be suppressed the traffic in the street of the town since those streets are precious to see and by car you lose much of the landscape .

I'm sorry, I use the bike lane, and if there's no bike lane I'll use the road, but you're the ones who don't respect it, because you invade the bicycle lane when you can't walk through it. You're wearing a hat and a hat, and you really don't have to generalize.
<br>In other countries the bike lane is not on the sidewalk, but on the road. The helmet is not mandatory in madrid, except for those under 16 years of age. If it is mandatory at night, it doesn't make sense not to wear them. The idea is not bad but proposed in another way would be better.
<br>The biggest offender is not the cyclist; only for a few who do the goat. In general, I repeat that I am not talking about you in particular but about what I see day by day, do not comply with the rules. I think the truth, especially for children, seems to me to be in favor of banning running on the streets.
<br>I must understand that the bike is an alternative to the car, motorcycle, or public transport. True, motorcycles reach higher speeds than bicycles, and therefore the risk of falling with injury/death increases. bicycles do not reach speeds as high as cars or motorcycles, so the possibility of injury in the event of an accident is less. this relationship is one that allows not to use the helmet to cyclists, provided that the basic traffic rules are met.
<br>The vast majority of accidents suffered by cyclists, are a consequence of the behaviors of other cars. I am also in favour of coexistence, but it is logical and reasonable also that there are certain things that are not logical. I honestly do not think that madrid is a city for bicycles, for its orography and influx of citizens.

first we would have to fine all those who use bicycles by failing to comply with the traffic code
<br>i 'm sorry, i use the bike lanekkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
<br>i have not talked about distracted , a pedestrian on the sidewalk can go as distracted as he wants if he hits someone is at 5 km/h and with the body not with a metal instrument like a bike and at a higher speed
<br>that a pedestrian can cause an accident or hurt , but minor and is " the weakest " as he loves to say to the cyclist collective when they defend themselves from the drivers
<br>the greater offender the cyclist, you will tell me why
<br>when the pedestrian according to the mobility ordinance fails to comply with the greater but all the rules
<br>like not stopping in groups to speak, run, jump or do any kind of act that bother the many users of the road
<br>the cyclists that you comment, are foreigners who use the electric bicycles of the madrid community
<br>those if i agree with you are the least to follow the rules of traffic
<br>but in the case of the road bicycles or mountain bikes , like this one mine
<br>the vast majority of accidents suffered by cyclists are a result of the behaviors of other cars
<br>i honestly do not think that madrid is a city for bicycles
<br>but as today is what is "politically correct " and what politicians believe that gives votes

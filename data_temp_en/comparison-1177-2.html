 to the editorials who live from a prehistoric model, not water. a greeting. what should inescapably be done is to reuse textbooks, and that all schools cover the same (recycled paper, color / bn, etc.). what makes the most sense is to develop/suffraise independently (i.e. without bias) an editorial line of school books.
<br> an example, the editorial mafias. if you can and don't need data, the question is do you want to invest in bulls or education? to set an example. I agree with you, that publishing is a business in my opinion excessive. I think the educational authorities should create and make available to the educational community a bank of digital and printable resources that would cover the pedagogical contents
<br> I will not touch you!!, besides there are many places to take away...I do not have children, but I support this request, we have to end the marketing of children's education, even if you don't have children.. without them and a good future you won't charge pensions!!! I do not think it will touch you.. I think it is a brilliant idea,

 it 's very true, in my daughter's school that is public, from 3-6 years all class material is paid in cooperative and the truth that works great, and above all children learn to share and care for class material. from 6 nose if they go with chips . 
<br>  all schools use the same. Free books should be licensed as cc by-sa, and accept the participation of independent experts, professionals in education . 
<br> the books do not change from one year to another. what less than 4 years with the same books?? being realistic, the contents cannot vary so much. I agree with the line of argument of re-using the books. in any case it would have to pay its amortization to acquire new books of updated editions . 
<br>  the cost would be paid in terms of taxes instead of in the bookstore, but at the end of anyway our money would end up in the hands of the editorials. by removing the disqualifications of both I agree, all that
<br> change.. I don't says it 's not necessary to use text books as it is being done to learn and less to change editorials every two years. everyone who pays taxes should be entitled to free books and should not discriminate if you study in a public or private school. of course . 
<br>  I could create a proposal on this, but I am not a specialist in training and didactics .

Free books should be extended to all types of centres covered by public centres. It is absurd to shift the (current) cost of parents' textbooks to the city hall. what is the point of subsidizing the bad practice of publishers? all content should be licensed as cc by-sa, and accept the participation of independent experts.
<br>In my opinion, books should belong to schools, and not to students. At the end of the course, all books should be returned in perfect condition. I think the same should be done with textbooks and library books: they are taken, used, and left as they are. I find it difficult that with the taxes that we pay public schools can take charge of that expense.

<br>as a teacher and mother i very much agree with you that publishing is a business in my opinion excessive
<br>i think that the educational authorities should create and make available to the educational community a bank of digital and or printable resources that would cover the pedagogical contents established by the law
<br>i find it difficult that with the taxes that we pay public schools can take charge of that expense
<br>it turns out that investing in education is everyone 's business
